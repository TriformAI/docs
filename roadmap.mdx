This page outlines features we're actively building or planning. Timelines are estimates and may change.

## In Progress

### Monitoring & Observability

**Target:** Q1 2026

Core observability infrastructure for understanding system behavior:

- **Logs** — Structured runtime messages with contextual fields (Node, Project, Execution)
- **Traces** — Step-by-step paths with timing across Nodes
- **Metrics** — Quantitative indicators (counts, durations, error rates)

**How you'll use it:**
- Inspect Executions to see logs and trace waterfalls
- Drill from an erroring Node into its Action context
- Compare metrics across Deploys to validate improvements

**Current focus:**
- Consistent event schemas across Actions/Flows
- Lightweight log ingestion with contextual fields
- Trace propagation through Agent tool calls

> tip: Log with intent — Emit concise, structured logs that capture what happened and why.

## Planned

### Chat Client

**Target:** Q2 2026

A customizable, embeddable chat widget connecting end-users directly to your Triform Agents.

**Key features:**
- Single-line JavaScript integration
- Customizable styling and branding
- Rich media support (images, code, forms)
- Built-in rate limiting and content filtering
- Mobile SDKs (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter)

**Use cases:** Customer support bots, product assistants, internal tools, e-commerce

---

### Alerts

**Target:** Q2 2026

Proactive notifications when critical conditions occur.

**Capabilities:**
- Define rules on logs, metrics, or evaluation scores
- Send to email, chat, and webhooks
- Group, dedupe, and throttle noisy signals
- Link alerts to remediation runbooks

**Example rules:**
- Error rate exceeds N% over M minutes
- Evaluation score falls below threshold for k runs
- Latency p95 exceeds T ms after deploy

---

### Persistent Storage

**Target:** Q3 2026

Managed storage for state that persists across executions.

**Use cases:**
- Session state for multi-turn conversations
- Caching expensive computations
- Storing user preferences
- Accumulating data across runs

---

### Evaluations

**Target:** Q3 2026

Automated quality assessment for AI outputs.

**Capabilities:**
- Define evaluation criteria and scoring rubrics
- Run evaluations on historical executions
- Track quality trends over time
- Set thresholds that trigger alerts

---

### Community Library

**Target:** Q4 2026

Shared repository of reusable components.

**Features:**
- Browse and search community contributions
- One-click import into your Projects
- Version management and updates
- Rating and review system

---

### Advanced Logging & Metrics

**Target:** Q4 2026

Extended observability capabilities.

**Logging:**
- Structured logging with log levels
- Advanced search and filtering
- Log streaming (real-time tail)
- External integrations (Datadog, Splunk, CloudWatch)

**Metrics:**
- Custom metric definitions (counters, gauges, histograms)
- Custom dashboards with drag-and-drop widgets
- Metric-based alerting
- External export (Prometheus, Graphite)

---

### Traces (Advanced)

**Target:** Q4 2026

Enhanced execution tracing and analysis.

**Capabilities:**
- Distributed tracing with span details
- LLM-specific tracing (prompts, tool calls, token usage)
- Cost attribution per span
- OpenTelemetry export (Jaeger, Zipkin)
- Flamegraph visualization

---

### Schedules (Enhanced)

**Target:** 2027

Advanced scheduling capabilities.

**Features:**
- Complex cron expressions
- Timezone-aware scheduling
- Schedule dependencies
- Pause and resume schedules
- Schedule versioning
