# Triform Documentation Guidelines

This document defines consistency standards for Triform documentation.

## Terminology Standards

### Use consistently:
- **Project Variables** (not "Global Variables")
- **Execute** (not "Run")
- **Canvas** (capitalized when referring to the UI component)
- **Top Bar**, **Chat Panel**, **Properties Panel** (capitalized UI components)
- **Triton** (the AI assistant, always capitalized)
- **Flow**, **Agent**, **Action**, **Project** (capitalized when referring to the component types)

### Component references:
- Actions — Python functions
- Agents — LLM-powered components
- Flows — Orchestration graphs
- Projects — Complete deployable systems

## Formatting Standards

### En dashes vs hyphens:
- Use **em dash (—)** for definitions: `**Term** — Definition`
- Use **hyphen (-)** for compound words: `end-to-end`, `AI-powered`
- Use **hyphen (-)** for bullet lists

### Lists:
```markdown
**Bold heading** — Description  
**Bold heading** — Description

OR

- Regular bullet point
- Regular bullet point
```

### Code examples:
```markdown
Example:
\`\`\`language
code here
\`\`\`
```

### Tips and warnings:
```markdown
> tip: Brief, actionable advice

> warning: Important cautionary information
```

## Style Guidelines

### Brevity:
- Keep documentation concise and scannable
- Remove redundant explanations
- Use clear, direct language
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity

### Structure:
- Start with "What is X?" section
- Provide concrete examples early
- Include troubleshooting at the end
- Link to related docs in "Next steps"

### Voice:
- Use second person ("you") when addressing the user
- Use active voice: "Click the button" not "The button should be clicked"
- Be conversational but professional
- Assume technical competence but explain concepts clearly

## API Documentation Format

When showing curl examples, always use this format:

```markdown
This is an API-call that would trigger a certain flow with the 
{payload} payload:

\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST 'https://app.triform.ai/api/in/{project-id}/{flow-id}' \
  --header 'Authorization: {api-key}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{payload}'
\`\`\`
```

### API standards:
- Use `--header` not `-H`
- Use `--data` not `-d`
- Authorization header: raw API key (no "Bearer" prefix)
- URL format: `https://app.triform.ai/api/in/{project-id}/{flow-id}`

## Content Organization

### Getting Started:
- Quickstart: 5-minute setup
- Login: Authentication details
- Workspace Overview: Interface introduction

### Tutorials:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Time estimates included
- Real-world examples
- Clear prerequisites

### Concepts:
- Concise explanations (aim for < 200 lines)
- Core principles and patterns
- Best practices
- Links to tutorials for hands-on

### Reference:
- Detailed technical specifications
- Complete option lists
- API documentation

## File Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `getting-started.mdx`
- Be descriptive: `edit-a-specific-component.mdx` not `edit-component.mdx`
- Group related docs in directories

## Changes Made (October 9, 2025)
