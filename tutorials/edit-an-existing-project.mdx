## Overview

This tutorial covers how to safely modify existing Projects, whether you created them, inherited them from teammates, or are exploring community templates.

**Time required:** 15-20 minutes

## Step 1: Open the Project

1. Navigate to **Home** in the Top Bar
2. Find your Project in the Projects list
3. Click to open it on the Canvas

You'll see the Project's component graph.

## Step 2: Understand the structure

Before making changes, map out what exists:

1. **Review the Canvas** — Note all Flows, Agents, and Actions
2. **Check dependencies** — See which components depend on others
3. **Read documentation** — Look for README or descriptions
4. **Ask Triton** — Type: _"Explain what this Project does"_

Triton will analyze the structure and provide a summary.

## Step 3: Identify what to change

Common modification scenarios:

### Adding a new feature

**Example:** Add email notifications to a data processing pipeline

1. Create a new Action: `send_email`
2. Add it to the relevant Flow
3. Connect it after the processing step
4. Configure SMTP settings in Project Variables

### Modifying an existing component

**Example:** Update an Agent's prompt

1. Select the Agent node
2. Open Properties → Content
3. Edit the System Prompt
4. Save changes (auto-saved)
5. Test with a sample payload

### Replacing a component

**Example:** Swap out an Action for a better implementation

1. Create the new Action
2. Ensure it has the same input/output schema
3. Disconnect the old Action
4. Connect the new one
5. Delete the old Action
6. Test thoroughly

### Debugging an issue

**Example:** A Flow is failing intermittently

1. Go to Properties → Executions
2. Find failed execution
3. Examine logs and errors
4. Identify the failing component
5. Ask Triton: _"Why is this Action failing?"_
6. Apply the fix
7. Re-run execution

## Step 4: Make the changes

Let's walk through a specific example: **Adding retry logic to an API call**

### Current state
Your `fetch_data` Action sometimes fails due to network timeouts.

### Goal
Add automatic retry with exponential backoff.

### Steps

1. **Open the Action**
   - Double-click the `fetch_data` node
   - Review the current `Action.py`

2. **Ask Triton for help**
   - _"Add retry logic with exponential backoff to this Action"_
   - Triton will update the code with a retry decorator

3. **Review the changes**
   ```python
   from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential
   
   @retry(
       stop=stop_after_attempt(3),
       wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=2, max=10)
   )
   def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict:
       # existing implementation
   ```

4. **Update requirements.txt**
   - Add `tenacity==8.2.3`

5. **Test the change**
   - Execute with a payload that previously failed
   - Verify retries happen (check logs)
   - Confirm eventual success

## Step 5: Test your changes

Always test modifications before deploying:

### Unit test individual components

1. Select the modified component
2. Use Properties → Execute with test data
3. Verify expected behavior

### Integration test the full Flow

1. Select the top-level Flow
2. Execute with realistic payloads
3. Check all outputs are correct

### Edge case testing

Test with:
- Empty inputs
- Maximum size inputs  
- Invalid data
- Network failures (if applicable)

## Step 6: Document your changes

Help your future self and teammates:

1. **Update descriptions**
   - Select the component
   - Update the description field
   - Note what changed and why

2. **Update README**
   - If the Project has a README, add notes
   - Document new dependencies or requirements

3. **Add comments in code**
   - Explain non-obvious logic
   - Note any workarounds or constraints

## Step 7: Deploy the updates

Once tested:

1. Click **Deploy** in the Top Bar
2. Select the environment
3. Review changes (diff view if available)
4. Add deployment notes
5. Click **Deploy Now**

For production Projects:
- Deploy to staging first
- Run smoke tests
- Monitor for issues
- Then deploy to production

## Step 8: Monitor post-deployment

After deploying:

1. **Watch initial executions**
   - Check the first few runs succeed
   - Look for unexpected errors

2. **Compare metrics**
   - Success rate before vs. after
   - Execution time
   - Error types

3. **Set up alerts**
   - Get notified if new issues arise
   - Track key metrics

## Common modification patterns

### Adding authentication

1. Create Project Variable for API key
2. Update relevant Actions to use the key
3. Test with valid and invalid keys

### Scaling for more data

1. Identify bottlenecks (single-threaded Actions)
2. Add parallel processing in Flows
3. Implement batching if needed
4. Test with large payloads

### Improving error handling

1. Add try-catch blocks in Actions
2. Return structured error responses
3. Add error routing in Flows
4. Set up failure notifications

### Optimizing performance

1. Profile slow components
2. Add caching where appropriate
3. Reduce unnecessary data passing
4. Parallelize independent operations

## Best practices

> **Version control** — Save the current state before major changes (export/backup)

> **Small iterations** — Make one change at a time, test, then move on

> **Ask for help** — Use Triton to explain complex parts before modifying

> **Test thoroughly** — Don't skip testing, especially for production Projects

> **Communicate** — If working in a team, coordinate changes

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Changes aren't taking effect  
**Solution:** Ensure you saved, redeploy if already deployed, clear any caches

**Problem:** Breaking existing functionality  
**Solution:** Review execution logs, compare with previous version, test each component

**Problem:** Can't understand the existing code  
**Solution:** Ask Triton to explain it, check for documentation, trace execution flow

**Problem:** Changes work locally but fail in production  
**Solution:** Check environment differences, verify Project Variables are set, review logs
