## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll build a **News Aggregator Project** that collects articles from multiple sources, summarizes them, and outputs a daily digest. You'll learn to:

- Create a Project from scratch
- Build Actions for data collection
- Design Flows for orchestration
- Configure an Agent for summarization
- Test and deploy your system

**Time required:** 20-30 minutes

## Step 1: Create the Project

1. Click the **Home** icon in the Top Bar
2. Click **New Project**
3. Name it `News Aggregator`
4. Add description: `Collects and summarizes news from multiple sources`
5. Click **Create**

Your Canvas now shows an empty Project node.

## Step 2: Build the fetch Action

Let's create an Action to fetch news from an API:

1. Open the Chat Panel
2. Say: _"Create an Action called `fetch_news` that takes a source URL and returns a list of articles"_
3. Triton will generate the Action with:
   - Input: `source_url` (string)
   - Output: `articles` (list of dicts)
   - Basic HTTP request logic

4. Review the generated `Action.py` in the Properties Panel
5. Adjust if needed (add error handling, rate limiting, etc.)

## Step 3: Create the aggregation Flow

Now build a Flow to call the Action for multiple sources:

1. Ask Triton: _"Create a Flow that takes a list of news sources and calls fetch_news for each one"_
2. Triton will create:
   - Input node with `sources` parameter
   - Loop or parallel execution of `fetch_news`
   - Output node with combined `articles`

3. Double-click the Flow node to inspect the structure
4. Verify the connections are correct

## Step 4: Add a summarization Agent

Create an Agent to summarize the collected articles:

1. Say: _"Create an Agent called `news_summarizer` that takes articles and creates a concise daily digest"_
2. Triton will configure:
   - System prompt for summarization
   - Input/output schema
   - Model selection (GPT-4 or Claude recommended)

3. Review and refine the system prompt:
   ```
   You are a news summarization expert. Given a list of news articles,
   create a concise, informative daily digest. Group by topic, highlight
   key trends, and maintain neutral tone. Output as structured markdown.
   ```

## Step 5: Connect the components

Wire everything together:

1. Create a main Flow called `daily_news_digest`
2. Structure it as:
   ```
   Input (sources list)
     → fetch_news_flow (aggregation)
     → news_summarizer (Agent)
     → Output (formatted digest)
   ```

3. You can do this via Triton or manually:
   - Drag components from the Agent Toolbox
   - Connect them with edges (click and drag from output to input ports)
   - Configure each node's parameters

## Step 6: Test with sample data

Execute your system:

1. Select the `daily_news_digest` Flow
2. Open Properties → Execute
3. Enter test payload:
   ```json
   {
     "sources": [
       "https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us",
       "https://api.example.com/tech-news",
       "https://api.example.com/world-news"
     ]
   }
   ```

4. Click **Execute**
5. Monitor execution in real-time
6. Review the output digest

## Step 7: Debug and iterate

If something goes wrong:

- Check execution logs in Properties → Executions
- Verify each component's input/output schema
- Test Actions individually before running the full Flow
- Ask Triton: _"Why did the execution fail?"_

Common issues:
- API authentication missing → Add API keys to Project Variables
- Timeout errors → Adjust Action timeout settings
- Empty results → Verify API endpoints are accessible

## Step 8: Deploy as API

Make your Project accessible:

1. Click **Deploy** in the Top Bar
2. Select deployment target (e.g., production)
3. Configure:
   - Endpoint path: `/daily-digest`
   - HTTP method: POST
   - Authentication: API key required

4. Click **Deploy Now**
5. Copy the generated endpoint URL
6. Test with curl:

This is an API-call that would trigger a certain flow with the 
{"sources": ["..."]} payload:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST 'https://app.triform.ai/api/in/31460071-17aa-43e8-a0e6-fb22984c0bdc/26420f15-2143-443f-bca9-45c5b0720784' \
     --header 'Authorization: 88ffe8398f972837ccc6e0a6cd31c5c92689040c' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{"sources": ["..."]}'
   ```

## Step 9: Schedule daily execution

Set up automatic runs:

1. In the Project Properties, go to **Triggers**
2. Click **Add Trigger**
3. Select **Schedule**
4. Configure:
   - Schedule: Daily at 6:00 AM UTC
   - Payload: Your default sources list
   - Notification: Email on success/failure

5. Save the trigger

## Next steps

Now that you've built a complete Project:

- **Enhance it** — Add sentiment analysis, language detection, custom formatting
- **Monitor it** — Set up alerts for failures or anomalies
- **Share it** — Invite team members to collaborate
- **Extend it** — Create variations for different news categories

## Tips for success

> **Start simple** — Build and test each component individually before connecting them

> **Use Project Variables** — Store API keys, base URLs, and configuration centrally

> **Save test payloads** — Keep example inputs for regression testing

> **Version your work** — Use meaningful names and descriptions for components

> **Iterate with Triton** — Don't hesitate to ask for modifications or explanations
