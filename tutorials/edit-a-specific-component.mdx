---

## Overview

This tutorial focuses on editing individual components (Agents, Flows, Actions) within a Project. You'll learn component-specific techniques for each type.

**Time required:** 10-15 minutes per component type

## Editing Actions

Actions are Python functions with inputs, outputs, and dependencies.

### Opening an Action

1. Double-click the Action node on the Canvas
2. The Properties Panel shows:
   - **Content tab** — Code editor for `Action.py`
   - **Input/Output tab** — Schema definition
   - **Requirements** — Python dependencies

### Modifying the code

**Example:** Add logging to a data processing Action

1. Select the Action
2. Open Properties → Content
3. Update the code:
   ```python
   import logging
   from typing import Dict, List
   
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
   
   def process_data(data: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
       logger.info(f"Processing {len(data)} items")
       
       processed = []
       for item in data:
           try:
               # processing logic
               result = transform(item)
               processed.append(result)
           except Exception as e:
               logger.error(f"Failed to process item: {e}")
               continue
       
       logger.info(f"Successfully processed {len(processed)} items")
       return processed
   ```

4. Update `requirements.txt` if adding dependencies
5. Click **Test** to run with sample input
6. Save (auto-saves)

### Changing input/output schema

1. Go to Properties → Input/Output
2. Modify the schema:
   - Add new fields
   - Change types
   - Update descriptions
   - Set required vs. optional

3. Update the code to match
4. Test with new schema

### Best practices for Actions

> **Keep them focused** — One clear purpose per Action

> **Type everything** — Use proper type hints for all parameters

> **Handle errors** — Don't let exceptions propagate unhandled

> **Test independently** — Each Action should work standalone

## Editing Flows

Flows are graphs of connected nodes.

### Opening a Flow

1. Double-click the Flow node
2. The Canvas zooms into the Flow's internal structure
3. You see: Input node, processing nodes, Output node, edges

### Adding nodes

**Via Triton:**
1. Ask: _"Add a data validation Action to this Flow"_
2. Triton adds the node and suggests connections

**Manually:**
1. Right-click the Canvas
2. Select **Add Node**
3. Choose from: Actions, Agents, sub-Flows
4. Drag to position

### Connecting nodes

1. Click and drag from an output port
2. Drop on an input port of another node
3. The edge shows data flow direction
4. Orange edges = control flow, Blue edges = data flow

### Modifying the structure

**Serial to parallel conversion:**

Before (serial):
```
Input → Action A → Action B → Action C → Output
```

After (parallel):
```
Input → Action A ↘
                  Action B → Merge → Output
        Action C ↗
```

Steps:
1. Add a Merge/Join node
2. Disconnect B and C from serial chain
3. Connect both to Merge
4. Connect Merge to Output

### Conditional routing

Add branching logic:

1. Add a Router node (or use Agent to decide)
2. Connect multiple output paths
3. Each path processes different scenarios
4. Reconnect at a Merge node if needed

Example:
```
Input → Router → [if premium] → Enhanced Processing → Output
              → [if basic]   → Standard Processing → Output
```

### Best practices for Flows

> **Left to right** — Arrange nodes in execution order

> **Group visually** — Related nodes should be close together

> **Name clearly** — Label nodes with their purpose

> **Test incrementally** — Verify each section works before adding more

## Editing Agents

Agents are LLM-powered components with prompts and tools.

### Opening an Agent

1. Double-click the Agent node
2. Properties Panel shows:
   - **Content tab** — Prompts and model config
   - **Toolbox** — Available tools (Actions/Flows)
   - **Execute tab** — Testing interface

### Modifying the System Prompt

The System Prompt defines the Agent's behavior.

**Example:** Improve a customer service Agent

Before:
```
You are a helpful assistant.
```

After:
```
You are a customer service expert for TechCorp, specializing in
subscription management and technical support. 

Guidelines:
- Always be polite and professional
- Verify the user's identity before accessing account information
- Offer solutions, not just explanations
- Escalate to human support if unable to resolve
- Document all actions taken in the conversation

Available tools:
- check_subscription_status: Get current subscription details
- update_billing: Modify billing information
- reset_password: Send password reset email
- escalate_to_human: Transfer to human support

Always confirm actions before executing them.
```

### Adding/removing tools

1. Go to Properties → Content → Toolbox
2. Click **Add Tool**
3. Select from available Actions/Flows
4. Tools appear in the Agent's context
5. Update the System Prompt to mention new tools

### Configuring model parameters

Adjust for your use case:

| Parameter | Low Value | High Value | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Temperature | 0.0-0.3 | 0.7-1.0 | Low: factual, consistent<br/>High: creative, varied |
| Top P | 0.1-0.5 | 0.9-1.0 | Low: focused<br/>High: exploratory |
| Max Tokens | 100-500 | 2000-4000 | Low: concise<br/>High: detailed |

### Testing Agent changes

1. Go to Properties → Execute
2. Enter a test message or payload:
   ```json
   {
     "messages": [
       {"role": "user", "content": "I need to cancel my subscription"}
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Click **Execute**
4. Review:
   - Agent's response
   - Tools called
   - Reasoning/chain of thought
   - Token usage

5. Iterate on prompts based on results

### Best practices for Agents

> **Be specific** — Vague prompts lead to unpredictable behavior

> **Limit tools** — Too many options confuse the Agent

> **Test edge cases** — Try to break it with unusual inputs

> **Monitor usage** — Track token costs and latency

## Using Triton for edits

Triton can help with all component types:

### For Actions
- _"Add error handling to this Action"_
- _"Optimize this function for large datasets"_
- _"Add logging at each step"_

### For Flows
- _"Add parallel processing to this Flow"_
- _"Insert a validation step after the input"_
- _"Add error routing to this Flow"_

### For Agents
- _"Make this Agent more concise in responses"_
- _"Add a tool for checking inventory"_
- _"Improve the prompt for customer service"_

## Version management

Track changes to components:

1. **Export before major changes**
   - Right-click component → Export
   - Save the JSON locally

2. **Meaningful naming**
   - Rename nodes with version info if needed
   - `CustomerServiceAgent_v2`

3. **Test before overwriting**
   - Create a copy to test changes
   - Compare performance
   - Merge if improvement is confirmed

## Common editing scenarios

### Scenario 1: Action is too slow

**Diagnosis:** Profile the Action, find bottlenecks

**Solutions:**
- Add caching for expensive operations
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Batch API calls instead of one-by-one
- Optimize algorithms (O(n²) → O(n log n))

### Scenario 2: Flow produces wrong output

**Diagnosis:** Trace the data through each node

**Solutions:**
- Check schema mismatches between nodes
- Add logging to intermediate nodes
- Test each node individually
- Verify edge connections are correct

### Scenario 3: Agent doesn't use tools

**Diagnosis:** Prompt doesn't encourage tool use

**Solutions:**
- Explicitly instruct: "Use available tools to answer"
- Provide examples of tool usage in prompt
- Reduce temperature for more deterministic behavior
- Simplify tool descriptions

### Scenario 4: Component works in test, fails in production

**Diagnosis:** Environment differences

**Solutions:**
- Check Global Variables are set in production
- Verify API keys and credentials
- Review rate limits and quotas
- Check for hardcoded values (don't do this!)
