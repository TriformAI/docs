# Triform

> Triform is a visual platform for building, running, and monitoring AI-powered systems. Users compose logic in the **Builder workspace** using a Canvas with Nodes (Agents, Flows, Actions) connected by Edges. Triton, the built-in AI assistant, helps build, modify, and debug Projects through natural conversation. The **Chat workspace** provides a conversational interface for using and interacting with completed agents.

## Core Concepts

**Projects** are complete, deployable AI systems containing Actions, Agents, and Flows. **Agents** are LLM-powered components with prompts, model configs, and tools. **Actions** are atomic Python functions with typed inputs/outputs. **Flows** are orchestration graphs connecting components with edges defining data flow.

**Important notes:**
- The **Builder workspace** contains the Canvas, Chat Panel (Triton), and Properties Panel for building
- The **Chat workspace** is for conversing with and using your agents (like ChatGPT)
- All components live within Organizations → Projects → Library hierarchy
- Executions are tracked with logs, traces, and metrics for debugging
- Projects deploy to staging/production and expose API endpoints
- Dependencies must be pure Python (no binary installs)
