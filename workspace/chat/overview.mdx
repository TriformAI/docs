## What you see

The Chat workspace provides a dedicated environment for conversing with your AI agents, similar to ChatGPT or other chat interfaces.

**Left Panel** — Chat history and conversation management  
**Middle Panel** — Active chat interface with your agent  
**Right Panel** — Project selector to enable agent capabilities

## Why use the Chat workspace

- **End-to-end conversations** — Have extended dialogues with your agents
- **Project-powered agents** — Enable specific projects to give your agent access to those capabilities
- **Clean interface** — Focus on conversation without the building tools
- **History management** — Review and continue past conversations

## When to use Chat vs Builder

**Use Chat when you want to:**
- Interact with completed agents
- Test agent behavior conversationally
- Share agent access with teammates
- Use your agent for actual work (not building)

**Use Builder when you want to:**
- Design and compose flows visually
- Debug component connections
- Configure agent tools and actions
- Build and modify your system

## Quick start

1. Navigate to the Chat workspace from the top bar
2. Select or create a new chat in the left panel
3. Enable relevant projects in the right panel
4. Start conversing with your agent in the middle

> tip: Enable projects strategically — only enable the projects your agent needs for the current task to keep responses focused and efficient.
