## What you see

The central chat interface where you communicate with your AI agent, displaying your messages and the agent's responses in a conversational format.

## Core interactions

**Send messages** — Type your message and press Enter or click Send  
**View responses** — Agent replies appear below your messages  
**Scroll history** — Review the full conversation thread  
**Format content** — Markdown is supported for rich text formatting

## Features

### Message composition

- Type naturally, just like any chat interface
- Multi-line messages supported (Shift + Enter for new line)
- Paste images and files (if supported)
- Edit recent messages (depending on configuration)

### Response formatting

Agent responses can include:
- Plain text explanations
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Lists and structured data
- Links and references
- Status updates and progress indicators

### Context awareness

The agent has access to:
- The full conversation history
- All enabled projects (from the right panel)
- Your organization's data and permissions
- Previous chat sessions (depending on configuration)

## Best practices

**Be specific** — Clear requests get better responses  
**Reference projects** — Mention specific project names when relevant  
**Break down complex tasks** — Ask step-by-step for complex workflows  
**Review enabled projects** — Make sure the agent has access to needed capabilities

> tip: If the agent doesn't have the capabilities you need, check the right panel to ensure the relevant projects are enabled.
