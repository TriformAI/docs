## What you see

The right panel shows all available projects in your organization that you can enable for the current agent conversation.

## How it works

**Enabled projects** = **Agent capabilities**

When you enable a project, you give the agent access to:
- All flows within that project
- All actions within that project
- All agents within that project (for nested agent calls)
- The project's variables and configuration

## Enabling and disabling projects

**Toggle on** — Click to enable a project for this chat  
**Toggle off** — Click to disable a project  
**Real-time updates** — Changes take effect immediately  
**Per-chat settings** — Each chat can have different enabled projects

## Project information

For each project, you can see:
- **Project name** — The identifier and title
- **Description** — What the project does
- **Components** — Number of agents, flows, and actions
- **Status** — Whether it's enabled for this chat

## Strategic enabling

**Enable only what you need:**
- Faster responses when fewer projects are active
- Clearer agent focus on relevant capabilities
- Reduced token usage and costs
- Less chance of unintended behavior

**When to enable multiple projects:**
- Tasks that span different domains
- Complex workflows requiring many tools
- Exploratory conversations where scope is unclear

## Permissions

You can only enable projects where you have:
- Read access at minimum
- Projects from your organization
- Projects shared with you

> tip: Start with just one or two relevant projects enabled. You can always enable more if the agent needs additional capabilities.
