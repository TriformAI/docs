## Overview

Effective navigation helps you move quickly between Projects, drill into components, and return to where you were. This guide covers navigation patterns, shortcuts, and best practices.

## Breadcrumb navigation

The **Top Bar** shows your current location:

```
Home > My Organization > Customer Service Project > Support Agent > Triage Flow
```

### Using breadcrumbs

**Click any level** to jump back:
- **Home** — All Projects view
- **Organization name** — Organization dashboard
- **Project name** — Project Canvas
- **Component name** — Component view

**Hover** to see quick actions for that level.

## Canvas navigation

### Zoom and pan

**Zoom:**
- Mouse wheel up/down
- Trackpad pinch
- `+` / `-` keys
- Zoom controls in bottom-right corner

**Pan:**
- Click and drag on empty Canvas space

- Press `R` to reset to default zoom

### Minimap

Toggle with `M` key or click the minimap icon.

The minimap shows:
- Full Canvas overview
- Current viewport (highlighted box)
- All nodes (small dots)

**Click anywhere** in minimap to jump to that area.

## Drilling down and up

**Quick switch:**
1. Click Project name in breadcrumbs
2. Type project name in search
3. Select from dropdown

**Recent Projects:**
- `Cmd+P` / `Ctrl+P` opens quick switcher
- Type to filter
- Arrow keys to select
- `Enter` to open

## Component navigation

### Finding components

**Toggle between views** using breadcrumbs or double-clicking nodes.

## Workspace panels

### Showing and hiding panels

**Top Bar** — Always visible  
**Canvas** — Always visible

## Navigation patterns

### Pattern 1: Top-down exploration

Starting from Project view:

1. Open Project
2. Identify main Flow
3. Double-click to see internal structure
4. Click specific Action/Agent to inspect
5. Use breadcrumbs to navigate back up

### Pattern 2: Component-focused workflow

Working on a specific component:

1. Quick search (`Cmd+K`) for component name
2. Open directly from results
3. Edit and test
4. Use "Find usages" to see where it's used
5. Navigate to parent Flows if needed

### Pattern 3: Debugging workflow

Tracking down an issue:

1. Go to Properties → Executions
2. Find failed execution
3. Click failing node in trace
4. Canvas jumps to that node
5. Inspect logs and fix
6. Re-run execution

### Pattern 4: Building workflow

Creating new components:

1. Start in Project view
2. Ask Triton to create components
3. Watch Canvas update in real-time
4. Double-click to refine
5. Connect components
6. Test incrementally

## Favorites and bookmarks

### Favoriting Projects

Star frequently-used Projects:

1. Hover over Project card
2. Click star icon
3. Access from "Favorites" filter

### Bookmarking views

Save specific Canvas states:

1. Arrange Canvas as desired
2. Right-click → **Bookmark View**
3. Name it (e.g., "Overview", "Error Handling Section")
4. Access from bookmarks dropdown

Useful for large Projects with many components.

## Navigation tips

## Mobile and tablet navigation

Triform is optimized for desktop, but you can view (read-only) on mobile:

- **Touch navigation** — Pinch to zoom, drag to pan
- **Tap nodes** — View details in Properties Panel
- **Breadcrumbs** — Navigate back up
- **Limited editing** — For safety, editing requires desktop

## Next steps

Practice navigating efficiently:

- Build a Project and drill into components
- Use keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Try the quick switcher (`Cmd+P`)
- Bookmark views in large Projects
- Ask Triton for navigation help
