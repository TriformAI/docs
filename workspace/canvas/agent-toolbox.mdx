description: "Configure agent tools and tips for curation"

## Characteristics

- Toolbox items are not connected by Edges.
- Tools are available for the Agent to invoke during execution.
- Tools can themselves contain other components.

## Creating tools

- Click the large ＋ to add a tool:
  - Action — atomic Python logic
  - Flow — orchestrated logic
  - Agent — nested agent for complex strategies

## Tips

- Keep tools small and testable.
- Prefer descriptive names (e.g., `fetch_user_profile`).
- Start with a few high‑value tools; expand as needs grow.

> note: Execution control — The Agent decides when to use tools; you define which tools it can use by curating the toolbox.
