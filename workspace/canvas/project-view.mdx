## Key points

- Items are not connected here; it’s an overview/list.
- Only top‑level Agents/Flows can be exposed via API or Schedule.
- Top‑level components can contain other components.

## Common actions

- Open a top‑level Agent/Flow to work inside it.
- Create a new Agent or Flow from the Canvas.
- Rename and organize to reflect your domain.

> tip: Design for exposure — If you plan to expose something as an API or Schedule, keep it top‑level and give it a stable name early.
