## Overview

When you double-click a Flow node on the Canvas, you enter **Flow View**—a detailed visualization of the Flow's internal structure showing all nodes, edges, and data flow.

## What you see in Flow View

### Nodes

- **Input Node** (green) — Entry point(s) for the Flow
- **Processing Nodes** (blue/purple) — Actions, Agents, sub-Flows
- **Output Node** (orange) — Exit point(s) from the Flow
- **Control Nodes** (gray) — Routers, merges, loops

### Edges

- **Blue edges** — Data flow connections
- **Orange edges** — Control flow (conditions, loops)
- **Dotted edges** — Optional connections

### Ports

- **Input ports** (left side) — Where data enters a node
- **Output ports** (right side) — Where data exits a node
- **Named ports** — Labeled for clarity (e.g., "success", "error")

## Basic interactions

### Navigation

- **Pan** — Click and drag on empty Canvas space
- **Zoom** — Mouse wheel or trackpad pinch
- **Fit to screen** — Press `F` or click the fit icon
- **Reset view** — Press `R` or click reset icon

### Selection

- **Select node** — Click on it
- **Multi-select** — Hold `Shift` and click multiple nodes
- **Select all** — `Cmd+A` (Mac) / `Ctrl+A` (Windows)
- **Deselect** — Click on empty Canvas space

### Node details

- **View properties** — Click a node, check Properties Panel
- **Edit node** — Double-click to open (if it's a Flow/Agent)
- **See connections** — Hover over ports to highlight edges

## Understanding data flow

### Following execution path

Edges show how data moves through your Flow:

```
Input → validate → [if valid] → process → format → Output
                   [if invalid] → error_handler → Output
```

**Left to right** — Execution generally flows from left to right  
**Branching** — Multiple outgoing edges = conditional routing  
**Merging** — Multiple incoming edges = combining results

## Common Flow patterns

### Linear Flow

```
Input → Action A → Action B → Action C → Output
```
Sequential processing, simple and predictable.

### Parallel Flow

```
Input → Action A ↘
              Action B → Merge → Output
      → Action C ↗
```
Independent operations run simultaneously, then results combine.

### Conditional Flow

```
Input → Router → [condition 1] → Action A → Output
              → [condition 2] → Action B → Output
              → [else] → Action C → Output
```
Different paths based on input data or logic.

### Loop Flow

```
Input → Process Item ↺ (for each item) → Collect Results → Output
```
Repeat an operation for multiple items.

### Error handling Flow

```
Input → Action → [success] → Format → Output
              → [error] → Log Error → Retry or Fail
```
Separate paths for success and failure scenarios.

## Creating and connecting nodes

### Adding nodes

**Method 1: Via Triton**
- _"Add a Action that validates output to this Flow"_
- Triton adds and suggests connections

**Method 2: Right-click menu**
1. Right-click on Canvas
2. Select **Add Node**
3. Choose: Action, Agent, Flow, Control
4. Position the node

### Connecting nodes

1. **Click and drag** from an output port
2. **Drop** on an input port of another node
3. The edge appears, showing data flow

**Tips:**
- You can only connect compatible types
- Hover over ports to see data schema
- Hold `Shift` while dragging for precise placement

### Disconnecting nodes

1. **Click** the edge to select it
2. **Press** `Delete` or `Backspace`
3. Or **right-click** edge → **Delete**

## Node interactions

### Moving nodes

- **Drag** to reposition
- **Arrow keys** for fine adjustment
- **Hold Shift** while dragging to constrain to axis

### Copying nodes

1. Select node(s)
2. `Cmd+C` / `Ctrl+C` to copy
3. `Cmd+V` / `Ctrl+V` to paste

### Deleting nodes

1. Select node(s)
2. Press `Delete` or `Backspace`
3. Confirm deletion (edges are also removed)

### Renaming nodes

1. Select the node
2. Edit the name in Properties Panel
3. Or double-click the node label (if editable)

## Input and Output nodes

### Input Node

Defines what data enters the Flow.

**Configuration:**
- **Schema** — Define expected fields and types
- **Validation** — Set required vs. optional fields
- **Defaults** — Provide default values
- **Description** — Document what this input represents

**Example:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "string (required)",
  "action": "enum: ['create', 'update', 'delete'] (required)",
  "data": "object (optional)"
}
```

### Output Node

Defines what data exits the Flow.

**Configuration:**
- **Schema** — Define output fields and types
- **Multiple outputs** — Named exit points (success, error, etc.)
- **Mapping** — Map internal data to output format
- **Description** — Document what this output represents

**Example:**
```json
{
  "status": "string",
  "result": "object",
  "execution_time_ms": "number"
}
```

## Advanced Flow View features

### Minimap

Shows the full Flow with current viewport indicator.

- Toggle with `M` key
- Click to jump to that area
- Useful for large Flows

### Node search

Find nodes in complex Flows:

1. Press `Cmd+F` / `Ctrl+F`
2. Type node name
3. Canvas highlights and zooms to matching nodes

### Layout auto-arrange

Organize messy Flows:

1. Select all nodes (or leave unselected for all)
2. Right-click → **Auto Layout**
3. Choose: Horizontal, Vertical, or Grid
4. Flow rearranges automatically

### Comments and annotations

Add notes to your Flow:

1. Right-click empty space
2. Select **Add Comment**
3. Type your note
4. Position it near relevant nodes

Use comments to:
- Explain complex logic
- Mark TODOs
- Document assumptions
- Highlight temporary workarounds

## Debugging in Flow View

### Viewing execution state

When an execution is selected:

- **Green nodes** — Executed successfully
- **Red nodes** — Failed
- **Gray nodes** — Skipped (not in execution path)
- **Yellow nodes** — Currently executing (live view)

### Inspecting node outputs

1. Select an execution in Properties → Executions
2. Click a node in Flow View
3. Properties Panel shows:
   - Input data received
   - Output data produced
   - Execution time
   - Logs and errors

### Finding bottlenecks

Node execution times are displayed:

- **Thick borders** — Slower nodes (longer execution)
- **Thin borders** — Fast nodes
- **Tooltip** — Shows exact timing on hover

Identify slow nodes to optimize.

## Best practices for Flow View

> **Left-to-right flow** — Arrange nodes in execution order

> **Group related nodes** — Position them close together

> **Use vertical space** — Separate parallel branches vertically

> **Minimize edge crossings** — Crossing edges are hard to follow

> **Label nodes clearly** — Descriptive names beat generic ones

> **Add comments** — Document non-obvious logic

> **Keep it shallow** — If too deep, split into sub-Flows

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut (Mac) | Shortcut (Windows) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Fit to screen | `F` | `F` |
| Reset view | `R` | `R` |
| Select all | `Cmd+A` | `Ctrl+A` |
| Copy | `Cmd+C` | `Ctrl+C` |
| Paste | `Cmd+V` | `Ctrl+V` |
| Delete | `Delete` | `Delete` |
| Undo | `Cmd+Z` | `Ctrl+Z` |
| Redo | `Cmd+Shift+Z` | `Ctrl+Shift+Z` |
| Find | `Cmd+F` | `Ctrl+F` |
| Toggle minimap | `M` | `M` |

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Can't connect two nodes  
**Solution:** Check that output type matches input type. Hover over ports to see schemas.

**Problem:** Flow is too large to see  
**Solution:** Press `F` to fit all, use minimap, or zoom out with mouse wheel.

**Problem:** Edges are crossing and confusing  
**Solution:** Use auto-layout, rearrange nodes manually, or split into sub-Flows.

**Problem:** Don't know what a node does  
**Solution:** Select it, check Properties Panel for description, or ask Triton.
