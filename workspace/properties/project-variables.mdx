## What to store

- Configuration values (e.g., feature flags, dataset names).
- Non‑secret constants used across Actions and Flows.

## Referencing variables

- Use variables in your Actions and configuration to avoid duplicating values.

## Tips

- Prefer descriptive names (e.g., `default_temperature`, `region`).
- Scope values per Project to keep experiments isolated.

> warning: Secrets — Store sensitive credentials in your secure mechanism of choice. Avoid committing secrets directly as plain variables.
