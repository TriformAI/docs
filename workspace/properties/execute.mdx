## Run a component

1. Select a Node (Project, Flow, Agent, or Action).
2. Open Execute.
3. Edit the JSON payload (starting from the default).
4. **Add Modifiers** (optional) — Configure OAuth credentials or other execution modifiers.
5. Click Run.

## Modifiers

Enhance your executions with additional context and credentials:

- **OAuth Modifiers** — Connect third-party services (Google, Slack, GitHub, etc.)
- **Secure credential injection** — OAuth tokens automatically passed to action execution
- **Automatic token refresh** — No manual token management required
- **Multiple providers** — Attach multiple OAuth connections to a single action

See [Modifiers](/concepts/modifiers) for detailed information on configuring OAuth and other modifiers.

## Project‑level exposure

- APIs/Schedules: choose which top‑level components to expose.
- API key: create and manage keys for access (Project scope).

## Tips

- Keep small, realistic payload examples for quick regression checks.
- Use parallel inputs thoughtfully (see Input & Output).
- Configure modifiers before running to test OAuth integrations.
- Test with real credentials in the Execute panel before deployment.

> note: Traceability — Executions emit logs, traces, and metrics that you can inspect later to understand runtime behavior.
