## Sections

- Global — Organization/Project‑level settings available to all components in the Project (e.g., Variables).
- Components — Definition/Information and Content for the selected Node.
- Execute — Run the selected Node with a JSON payload.
  - **Modifiers** — Configure OAuth credentials and execution modifiers (within Execute)
- Input & Output — Define inputs/outputs, types, defaults, and parallel execution behavior.

## Modifiers Panel

Within the Execute section, you can configure modifiers that enhance your executions:

- **OAuth Modifiers** — Connect third-party services like Google, Slack, GitHub, Microsoft, etc.
- **Credential Management** — Securely authorize and manage OAuth connections
- **Scope Configuration** — Set fine-grained permissions for each OAuth provider
- **Real-time Status** — See connection status and token health

Modifiers allow your actions to securely access external APIs with automatic token management and refresh.

> note: Context aware — The Properties Panel shows only the sections relevant to your current selection (Project, Flow, Agent, or Action).
