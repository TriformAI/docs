## What is the Chat Panel

The Chat Panel in the **Builder workspace** provides access to Triton, your AI assistant for building and designing systems. This is different from the **Chat workspace**, which is for using and conversing with your completed agents.

**Builder Chat Panel (Triton)** — Build, wire, debug  
**Chat Workspace** — Use and converse with agents

## What you can do

- Author components ("Create a Flow named ingest with input `text`").
- Wire connections ("Connect `Input.text` to `normalize.input`").
- Run executions ("Run the Flow with `{ \"text\": \"hello\" }`").
- Explain structures ("What does this Flow do?").

## @‑context

- Type `@` to reference a component (e.g., `@summarize_text`).
- Triton focuses actions and answers on what you mention.

## Activity updates

- Triton posts status messages when it performs changes or runs tasks.

> tip: Be explicit — Include component names and ports in your messages to avoid ambiguity and speed up Triton's actions.
