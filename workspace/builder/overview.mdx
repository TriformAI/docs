## What you see

The Builder workspace is where you design, compose, and debug your AI systems using visual tools and components.

**Canvas** — Visual workspace with nodes and edges  
**Chat Panel (Triton)** — AI assistant for building  
**Properties Panel** — Configuration and execution controls

## Why use the Builder workspace

- **Visual composition** — See your system architecture at a glance
- **Component building** — Create agents, flows, actions, and projects
- **Debugging** — Test and refine components with execution controls
- **Triton assistance** — Get help building from the AI assistant

## When to use Builder vs Chat

**Use Builder when you want to:**
- Design and compose flows visually
- Create new agents, flows, or actions
- Debug component connections
- Configure properties and test executions
- Build and modify your system architecture

**Use Chat when you want to:**
- Interact with completed agents
- Test agent behavior conversationally
- Use your agent for actual work
- Share agent access with teammates

## Core components

### Canvas

The visual workspace where you:
- Compose nodes (Agents, Flows, Actions, Projects)
- Connect nodes with edges to define logic flow
- Organize your system architecture visually
- Navigate between nested components

### Chat Panel (Triton)

Your AI building assistant that can:
- Author components from natural language
- Wire connections between nodes
- Run test executions
- Explain structures and help debug

### Properties Panel

Configuration and control center where you:
- View and edit component properties
- Configure inputs and outputs
- Execute components with test payloads
- Manage project variables

> tip: Use Triton in the Chat Panel to quickly build components by describing what you want, then refine them visually on the Canvas.

## Quick start

1. Navigate to the Builder workspace from the top bar
2. Create or open a Project on the Canvas
3. Ask Triton to build something, or drag components from the toolbox
4. Configure and execute from the Properties Panel

## Best practices

**Keep flows modular** — Break complex logic into reusable components  
**Name clearly** — Use descriptive names for all nodes  
**Test frequently** — Execute components as you build  
**Use Triton** — Leverage the AI assistant for faster development
