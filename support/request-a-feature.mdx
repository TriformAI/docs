## We Want Your Ideas!

Your feedback shapes Triform's future. We actively consider all feature requests and build the most popular and impactful ones.

## Before Requesting

### 1. Check if it already exists

- [ ] Search [documentation](/getting-started/quickstart) — Feature might already exist
- [ ] Check [Roadmap](/roadmap/alerts) — It might be planned
- [ ] Search [Discord #feature-requests](https://discord.gg/triform) — Someone might have requested it

### 2. Check if there's a workaround

Ask Triton or in Discord #help if there's another way to accomplish your goal.

### 3. Consider the scope

**Good requests:**
- Solve a clear problem
- Would benefit many users
- Align with Triform's mission

**Less likely to build:**
- Extremely niche (< 1% of users)
- Outside our scope (not AI automation related)
- Already possible with existing features

## How to Request a Feature

### Option 1: Discord (Recommended)

1. Join [Discord server](https://discord.gg/triform)
2. Go to #feature-requests channel
3. Describe your idea
4. Community votes with reactions

**Benefits:**
- Community can upvote
- Discussion and refinement
- Quick team feedback
- Visibility

### Option 2: Email

**Send to:** product@triform.ai  
**Subject:** `[Feature Request] Brief description`

**Benefits:**
- Direct to product team
- Can include detailed docs/mockups
- Private if needed

### Option 3: In-App

1. Click the **lightbulb icon** in bottom-right
2. Choose "Feature Request"
3. Fill out form
4. Submit

**Benefits:**
- Quick and easy
- Auto-includes context

## What to Include

Great feature requests answer these questions:

### 1. What problem does it solve?

Describe the pain point or limitation you're facing.

**Example:**  
_"When I have many Projects, it's hard to find the one I need. I waste time scrolling through the list."_

### 2. What's your proposed solution?

How would you like it to work?

**Example:**  
_"Add a search bar at the top of the Projects list where I can type part of the Project name. It would filter the list in real-time as I type."_

### 3. Why does it matter?

Explain the impact. How would this help you and others?

**Example:**  
_"This would save me 5-10 minutes per day. With 50+ Projects, finding the right one is frustrating. I think many users with lots of Projects would benefit."_

### 4. Are there examples elsewhere?

Reference similar features in other tools if helpful.

**Example:**  
_"Similar to how GitHub has instant search for repositories, or how VS Code has a command palette."_

### 5. Mockups or diagrams (optional but helpful)

Visual representations help us understand your vision.

- Sketch on paper and photo
- Digital mockup (Figma, etc.)
- Annotated screenshot
- Flowchart or diagram

## Feature Request Template

Copy and use this template:

```markdown
**Feature Name:**
[Short, descriptive name]

**Problem:**
[What problem does this solve? What's the current pain point?]

**Proposed Solution:**
[How would you like it to work? Describe the feature.]

**Why It Matters:**
[Impact and benefits. Who would use this? How often?]

**Alternatives Considered:**
[Other ways you thought about solving this, or workarounds you're using now]

**Examples:**
[Similar features in other tools, or references]

**Mockups/Diagrams:**
[Attach or link to visuals]

**Priority for You:**
[ ] Critical - blocking my work
[ ] High - would significantly improve my workflow
[ ] Medium - nice to have
[ ] Low - minor convenience

**Use Case:**
[Describe your specific use case or user story]
```

## Prioritization

We evaluate feature requests on:

### User impact

**High impact:** Affects many users, solves common pain point  
**Medium impact:** Helps specific user group or workflow  
**Low impact:** Nice-to-have, minor convenience

### Effort

**Quick wins:** High impact, low effort → Built soon  
**Strategic bets:** High impact, high effort → Planned carefully  
**Low priority:** Low impact, high effort → Unlikely to build

### Alignment

**Core mission:** Directly supports AI automation → Likely to build  
**Adjacent:** Related but not core → Maybe  
**Off-mission:** Unrelated to AI automation → Unlikely

### Votes

Popular requests (Discord reactions, multiple requests) get higher priority.

## What We Won't Build

To stay focused, we won't build:

❌ **Data warehouse** — Use external databases, we integrate  
❌ **Standalone LLM training** — Use pre-trained models  
❌ **CRM/Marketing automation** — Not our focus  
❌ **Generic no-code builder** — We're AI-automation specific
