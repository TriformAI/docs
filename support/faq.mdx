## Getting Started

### What is Triform?

Triform is a visual platform for building, running, and monitoring AI-powered systems. You compose logic on a Canvas as nodes (Agents, Flows, Actions) and connect them with edges, instead of writing traditional code.

### Who is Triform for?

- **Engineers** building end-to-end AI workflows
- **Product teams** iterating quickly on prototypes
- **Non-technical collaborators** reviewing and testing behavior

### Is Triform free?

Yes! We offer a generous free tier perfect for learning and small projects. Pro and Enterprise plans available for production use and teams.

### How do I sign up?

Visit [app.triform.ai](https://app.triform.ai) and sign in with Discord, GitHub, or email magic link. No credit card required for free tier.

### What can I build with Triform?

- Tool-using **Agents** that call Actions/Flows
- **Flows** that orchestrate multi-step logic
- **Actions** that run Python code
- APIs or scheduled jobs that expose components

**Examples:** Customer support bots, data processing pipelines, content generators, research assistants

## Account & Billing

### How do I upgrade my plan?

Account Settings → Billing → Change Plan. Changes take effect immediately, prorated billing.

### Can I downgrade?

Yes, at any time. Downgrade takes effect at end of current billing period. No refunds for unused time.

### What payment methods do you accept?

Credit/debit cards via Stripe. Enterprise can use invoicing.

### Do you offer discounts?

- **Annual plans:** 20% off vs. monthly
- **Nonprofits:** 50% off Pro plan (apply via email)
- **Students:** Free Pro plan (verify .edu email)
- **Startups:** Special pricing (apply via sales)

### Can I get a refund?

30-day money-back guarantee for first purchase. No refunds after that, but you can cancel anytime.

### How does billing work for organizations?

One subscription covers all members in an Organization. Pricing based on usage and team size.

## Projects & Components

### What's the difference between a Project, Flow, Agent, and Action?

- **Project:** Top-level container, the deployable unit
- **Flow:** Orchestration graph connecting components
- **Agent:** LLM-powered decision-maker with tools
- **Action:** Python function for specific tasks

### Can I reuse components across Projects?

Yes! Components in your Organization library can be used in any Project.

### How many Projects can I create?

- **Free:** 3 Projects
- **Pro:** 25 Projects
- **Enterprise:** Unlimited

### Can I share Projects with teammates?

Yes! Invite teammates to your Organization. They can view/edit based on their role.

### Can I export my Projects?

Yes. Right-click Project → Export to download JSON. Import into another Organization if needed.

## Executions

### What is an execution?

An execution is a single run of a Project/Flow/Agent/Action. Each execution has inputs, outputs, logs, and metrics.

### How many executions are included in my plan?

- **Free:** 1,000/month
- **Pro:** 50,000/month
- **Enterprise:** Custom

Overage available at $0.01/execution.

### How long are execution logs retained?

- **Free:** 7 days
- **Pro:** 30 days
- **Enterprise:** 90 days or custom

Export logs before they're deleted.

### Can I replay a failed execution?

Yes! Open execution → Replay. You can modify the input if needed.

### Why is my execution slow?

Common causes:
- Large dependencies (slow cold starts)
- Sequential instead of parallel processing
- API call latency
- Inefficient code

Use execution traces to identify bottlenecks. Ask Triton for optimization suggestions.

## Agents & LLMs

### Which LLM models are supported?

- **OpenAI:** GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5
- **Anthropic:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Haiku
- **More coming soon**

### Do I need my own API keys?

**Free tier:** Use our keys (with quota limits)  
**Pro/Enterprise:** Use your own keys for unlimited usage

### How much do LLM calls cost?

Depends on the model and your API key:
- Using our keys: Included in quota
- Using your keys: Charged by provider (OpenAI, Anthropic)

### Can Agents call external APIs?

Yes! Create Actions that call APIs, then give those Actions as tools to Agents.

### How do I make Agent responses more consistent?

- Lower temperature (0-0.3 for deterministic)
- More specific system prompts
- Add examples in the prompt
- Use structured outputs

## Actions

### What programming language do Actions use?

Python 3.11. We're exploring other languages for the future.

### What Python packages can I use?

Most pure-Python packages from PyPI. Some limitations:
- ✅ requests, pandas, numpy, etc.
- ❌ Packages requiring system binaries
- ❌ Packages needing root access

See [Requirements](/concepts/requirements) for details.

### Can Actions access databases?

Yes! Use database client libraries (psycopg2, pymongo, etc.). Store connection strings in Global Variables.

### How long can Actions run?

- **Free:** 30 seconds max
- **Pro:** 5 minutes max
- **Enterprise:** 30 minutes max

For longer tasks, split into multiple Actions or use async patterns.

### Can Actions write files?

No persistent file system. Each execution has temporary storage that's cleared after. Use external storage (S3, etc.) for persistence.

## Deployments

### How do I deploy a Project?

Click **Deploy** in Top Bar → Select environment → Configure → Deploy.

### What's the difference between staging and production?

**Staging:** Pre-production testing, internal access  
**Production:** Live, external access, production credentials

Always test in staging before deploying to production.

### Can I rollback a deployment?

Yes! Deployments → History → Select previous version → Rollback. Takes 30-60 seconds.

### How do I update a deployed Project?

Make changes in development → Test → Deploy again. New deployment replaces old one.

### Is there downtime during deployment?

- **Standard:** Brief downtime (< 1 minute)
- **Enterprise:** Zero-downtime deployments available

## API & Integration

### How do I call my deployed Project from my app?

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.triform.ai/v1/your-org/your-project \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"input": "data"}'
```

See [Integration Tutorial](/tutorials/integrate-project-into-your-app) for details.

### What's the API rate limit?

- **Free:** 60 requests/minute
- **Pro:** 600 requests/minute
- **Enterprise:** Custom

Exceeding triggers 429 response. Wait and retry.

### Can I use webhooks?

Yes! Set up webhook triggers to execute Projects when external events occur.

### Do you have SDKs?

Python and JavaScript SDKs available. More languages coming soon.

### Can I use Triform in my CI/CD pipeline?

Yes! Deploy via API or CLI (coming soon). See [Deployment](/concepts/deployments) for details.

## Security & Privacy

### Is my data secure?

Yes. We use:
- AES-256 encryption at rest
- TLS 1.2+ in transit
- Access controls and auditing
- Regular security audits

See [Security Overview](/security/overview) for details.

### Where is my data stored?

**Standard:** US data centers (AWS)  
**Enterprise:** EU and APAC options available

### Can I use Triform for HIPAA data?

Not yet. HIPAA compliance coming in 2026 for Enterprise tier.

**No, never.** We don't sell, rent, or share your data with third parties for marketing.

### Can I delete my data?

Yes. Delete Projects anytime. Delete account in Account Settings → Privacy. Data permanently deleted after 30 days.

## Troubleshooting

### I can't log in

- Try password reset (if using email)

- Try incognito mode
- Clear cookies
- Contact support@triform.ai

### My execution keeps failing

- Check execution logs for errors
- Verify input payload matches schema
- Test components individually
- Check Global Variables are set
- Ask Triton: _"Why did execution #ID fail?"_

### Triton isn't responding
