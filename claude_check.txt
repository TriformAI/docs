Looking at the commits provided, I can see there's a **BREAKING** change:

- `43d697d BREAKING: Remove legacy Canvas API, add Visual Graph API`

This is a breaking change that removes a legacy API and adds a new one, which absolutely requires documentation updates.

Additionally, there are several significant feature additions and fixes that would benefit from documentation:
- New automatic docs update and PR creation workflow
- Migration from Claude CLI to Anthropic SDK Node.js
- Improved Claude response parsing
