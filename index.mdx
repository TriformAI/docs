Triform is a visual platform for building, running, and monitoring AI-powered systems. Instead of stitching together code and configs, you **compose logic on a Canvas** by just chatting with it, then **use your agents** in a dedicated Chat interface.

## Who this is for

- Non-technical users wanting to automate their work or tasks
- Engineers building complex end-to-end Agentic workflows
- Product teams iterating quickly on automation prototypes

## Quickstart

1. **Sign in** at [app.triform.ai](https://app.triform.ai) with Discord or GitHub
2. You land in your first **Project** in the **Builder workspace**
3. **Chat** with Triton and ask him to build something
4. **Watch** Triton plan, build, and test your solution
5. **Switch** to the **Chat workspace** to use your agent conversationally

> tip: Start with a Flow: _"Build me a news gatherer that collects news from Swedish sources and summarizes them"_. Execute with a test payload to verify your setup.

## What you can build

- Tool-using **Agents** that call Actions/Flows
- **Flows** that orchestrate multi-step logic
- **Actions** that run precise Python code
- APIs or scheduled jobs that expose top-level components

## How Triform is organized

**Organizations** — Top-level ownership and access  
**Projects** — Focused workspaces inside an Organization  
**Library** — Reusable building blocks (Actions, Flows, etc.)  
**Builder** — The visual workspace where you design and debug  
**Chat** — The conversational workspace where you use and share your creations

## Need help?

- In **Builder**: Use the Chat Panel and talk to Triton to create, connect, or run components
- In **Chat**: Enable the right projects and converse with your agents
- Invite teammates from Profile → Organization → View
- Share feedback anytime—your input shapes our roadmap
