Triform is a visual platform for building, running, and monitoring AI-powered systems. Instead of stitching together code and configs, you **compose logic on a Canvas** as Nodes (Agents, Flows, Actions) and connect them with Edges.

## Who this is for

- Engineers building end-to-end AI workflows
- Product teams iterating quickly on prototypes
- Non-technical collaborators reviewing and testing behavior

## Quickstart

1. **Sign in** at [app.triform.ai](https://app.triform.ai) with Discord or GitHub
2. You land in your first **Project** with the **Canvas** open
3. **Chat** with Triton and ask him to build something
4. **Watch** Triton plan, build, and test your solution
5. **Execute** it from the **Properties → Execute** panel

> tip: Start with a Flow: _"Build me a news gatherer that collects news from Swedish sources and summarizes them"_. Execute with a test payload to verify your setup.

## What you can build

- Tool-using **Agents** that call Actions/Flows
- **Flows** that orchestrate multi-step logic
- **Actions** that run precise Python code
- APIs or scheduled jobs that expose top-level components

## How Triform is organized

**Organizations** — Top-level ownership and access  
**Projects** — Focused workspaces inside an Organization  
**Library** — Reusable building blocks (Actions, Flows, etc.)  
**Canvas** — The visual surface where you design and debug

## Need help?

- Use the Chat Panel (Triton) to create, connect, or run components
- Invite teammates from Profile → Organization → View
- Share feedback anytime—your input shapes our roadmap
