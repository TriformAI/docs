# Triform

> Triform is a visual platform for building, running, and monitoring AI-powered systems. Users compose logic on a Canvas using Nodes (Agents, Flows, Actions) connected by Edges. Triton, the built-in AI assistant, helps build, modify, and debug Projects through natural conversation.

## Core Concepts

**Projects** are complete, deployable AI systems containing Actions, Agents, and Flows. **Agents** are LLM-powered components with prompts, model configs, and tools. **Actions** are atomic Python functions with typed inputs/outputs. **Flows** are orchestration graphs connecting components with edges defining data flow.

**Important notes:**
- The Canvas is the visual workspace; Chat Panel (Cmd/Ctrl+K) accesses Triton
- All components live within Organizations → Projects → Library hierarchy
- Executions are tracked with logs, traces, and metrics for debugging
- Projects deploy to staging/production and expose API endpoints
- Dependencies must be pure Python (no binary installs)

## About this file

This page follows the [llms.txt specification](https://llmstxt.org/) - a proposed standard for providing LLM-friendly information to help AI assistants use website documentation at inference time. The plain text version is available at `/llms.txt`.
