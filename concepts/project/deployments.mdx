## What deploy does

- Captures current Node definitions and wiring.
- Makes exposed top‑level Agents/Flows use the latest configuration.

## Recommended flow

1. Finalize changes on the Canvas.
2. Re‑run Payloads for sanity checks.
3. Click Deploy.
4. Re‑hit APIs/Schedules if applicable.

## Troubleshooting

- Mismatched inputs — Verify Input/Output port names.
- Toolbox drift — Ensure Agent tools are up to date pre‑deploy.
- Missing variables — Double‑check required Project Variables.

> tip: Deploy in small steps — Smaller, frequent deploys make issues easier to pinpoint and roll forward from.
