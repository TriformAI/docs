## What deploy does

- Captures current Node definitions and wiring.
- Makes exposed top‑level Agents/Flows use the latest configuration.

## Recommended flow

1. Finalize changes on the Canvas.
2. Re‑run Payloads for sanity checks.
3. Click Deploy.
4. **Test immediately** — The system now transitions seamlessly to chat for testing after deployment.
5. Re‑hit APIs/Schedules if applicable.

## Deploy & Chat integration

Recent improvements streamline the deploy-to-test workflow:

- **Automatic chat transition** — After deploying, you can immediately test via chat interface
- **Seamless workflow** — Build → Deploy → Chat → Iterate without manual navigation
- **Better validation** — Test your deployment interactively before exposing to production

## Troubleshooting

- Mismatched inputs — Verify Input/Output port names.
- Toolbox drift — Ensure Agent tools are up to date pre‑deploy.
- Missing variables — Double‑check required Project Variables.

> tip: Deploy in small steps — Smaller, frequent deploys make issues easier to pinpoint and roll forward from.
