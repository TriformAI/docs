## Core Concepts

### Action
A Python function that performs a specific task. Actions are deterministic, reusable building blocks for Flows. Examples: API calls, data transformations, validations.

### Agent
An LLM-powered component that can make decisions, generate content, and use tools. Agents have system prompts, model configurations, and access to Actions/Flows as tools.

### API Key
A secret token used to authenticate requests to Triform's API. Required for executing deployed Projects and accessing Triform services programmatically.

### Canvas
The visual workspace where you build and view Projects, Flows, and their components. The Canvas displays nodes and edges showing system structure.

### Deployment
The process of publishing a Project to a live environment (staging or production) where it's accessible via API or triggers.

### Edge
A connection between two nodes in a Flow, showing data or control flow direction. Edges define how information moves through your system.

### Execution
A single run of a Project, Flow, Agent, or Action. Each execution has inputs, outputs, logs, and metrics. Executions are tracked for observability and debugging.

### Flow
An orchestration graph that connects Actions, Agents, and sub-Flows. Flows define multi-step logic with inputs, outputs, and data flow between components.

### Global Variable
An environment-specific value (API keys, config, secrets) accessible across Projects. Variables keep sensitive data out of code and enable environment-specific configuration.

### Node
A visual element on the Canvas representing a component (Action, Agent, Flow, Project) or control structure (Router, Merge, Loop).

### Organization
The top-level entity that owns Projects, members, and billing. Organizations provide team collaboration and access control.

### Payload
The JSON input data provided when executing a component. Payloads must match the defined input schema.

### Project
A complete, deployable AI system containing Actions, Agents, and Flows. Projects are the primary unit of work in Triform.

### Trigger
An automated mechanism that executes a Project in response to events (webhooks, schedules, manual API calls).

## Platform Components

### Agent Toolbox
A panel showing available components (Actions, Agents, Flows) that can be dragged onto the Canvas or reused across Projects.

### Chat Panel
The interface for interacting with Triton, Triform's AI assistant. The Chat Panel enables conversational building, editing, and debugging.

### Input Node
The entry point of a Flow, defining what data the Flow expects. Input nodes have schemas specifying required and optional fields.

### Output Node
The exit point of a Flow, defining what data the Flow returns. Output nodes shape the API response for deployed Projects.

### Properties Panel
A panel showing detailed configuration for selected components. Properties include content (code, prompts), input/output schemas, executions, and settings.

### Top Bar
The navigation bar showing breadcrumbs, home, profile, and deploy controls. The Top Bar provides global navigation and actions.

### Triton
Triform's built-in AI assistant that helps you build, modify, and debug Projects through natural conversation.

## Technical Terms

### Breadcrumb
Navigation elements showing your current location in the hierarchy (e.g., Home > Project > Flow > Agent). Click any level to jump back.

### Cron Expression
A time-based schedule format for triggering periodic executions. Example: `0 6 * * *` means daily at 6 AM.

### Dependency
An external Python package required by an Action. Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### HMAC Signature
A cryptographic signature used to verify webhook authenticity. Ensures requests came from expected sources.

### Idempotency
The property where performing the same operation multiple times produces the same result. Important for handling duplicate webhooks.

### Port
An input or output connection point on a node. Data flows from output ports to input ports via edges.

### Rate Limit
A restriction on how many requests can be made in a time period. Protects against abuse and ensures fair usage.

### Requirements.txt
A file listing Python package dependencies for an Action. Format follows pip conventions.

### Retry Logic
Automatic re-execution of failed operations, typically with exponential backoff. Handles transient failures gracefully.

### Rollback
Reverting a deployment to a previous version. Used when new deployments have issues.

### Schema
A definition of data structure specifying field names, types, and validation rules. Used for inputs, outputs, and payloads.

### System Prompt
Instructions given to an Agent defining its behavior, personality, and capabilities. System prompts guide Agent responses.

### Timeout
Maximum time allowed for an execution before it's canceled. Prevents infinite loops and hung processes.

### Token
In LLM context, a unit of text (roughly a word or sub-word). Token usage is tracked for cost and limits.

### Trace
A detailed record of execution showing which nodes ran, in what order, with what data and timing. Essential for debugging.

### Webhook
An HTTP endpoint that receives event notifications from external services. Triggers Project execution based on external events.

## Workflow Terms

### Branching
When a Flow splits into multiple paths based on conditions. Example: route by user tier (free vs. premium).

### Canary Deployment
Gradual rollout of changes to a percentage of traffic before full deployment. Reduces risk of bad deployments.

### Cold Start
The initial delay when executing a component that hasn't run recently. Caused by environment setup and dependency loading.

### Concurrency
Number of simultaneous executions. Can be limited to control resource usage or ensure serial processing.

### Fanout/Fanin
Fanout: One node sends data to multiple nodes (parallel processing). Fanin: Multiple nodes send data to one node (merging results).

### Merge Node
A control node that combines multiple inputs into one output. Used after parallel operations.

### Parallel Processing
Executing multiple operations simultaneously instead of sequentially. Improves performance for independent tasks.

### Router Node
A control node that directs data down different paths based on conditions. Enables branching logic in Flows.

### Serial Processing
Executing operations one at a time in sequence. Each step waits for the previous one to complete.

### Sub-Flow
A Flow used as a component within another Flow. Enables modularity and reusability.

## Environment Terms

### Development (Dev)
The environment where you actively build and test. Changes are immediate, no deployment needed.

### Production (Prod)
The live environment serving real users. Requires deployment and should be stable.

### Staging
A pre-production environment for testing. Mirrors production configuration but isolated from real traffic.

## Access Control

### Admin
A role with full permissions: create, edit, delete, deploy, manage members, billing.

### Editor
A role with permission to create and edit Projects but not manage members or billing.

### Member
A user belonging to an Organization with assigned roles and permissions.

### Viewer
A role with read-only access. Can view Projects and executions but not modify.

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Alert
A notification triggered by specific conditions (e.g., execution failure, high error rate). Sent via email, Slack, or webhook.

### Error Rate
Percentage of executions that failed. Used to monitor system health.

### Execution Log
Detailed text output from an execution including debug, info, warning, and error messages.

### Metric
Quantitative measurement of system behavior (execution time, success rate, token usage, cost).

### Success Rate
Percentage of executions that completed successfully. Key health indicator.

## Integration Terms

### API Endpoint
A URL where your deployed Project is accessible. Format: `https://api.triform.ai/v1/org/project`.

### Bearer Token
Authentication method where API key is sent in Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.

### CI/CD
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. Automated testing and deployment pipelines.

### SDK
Software Development Kit. Client libraries for accessing Triform API from code (Python, JavaScript, etc.).

### Webhook Payload
The JSON data sent to your webhook endpoint by external services. Must be transformed to match your Project's input schema.

## Billing & Quotas

### Execution-based Quota
Limits on number of executions per time period. Varies by plan tier.

### Resource-based Quota
Limits on storage, dependencies size, and similar resources. Varies by plan tier.

### Token Usage
For LLMs, the number of tokens consumed. Tracked for billing and optimization.

## Best Practices Terms

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Extract repeated logic into reusable Actions or Flows instead of duplicating.

### Idiomatic Code
Code following language conventions and best practices. Python Actions should follow PEP 8.

### Type Hints
Python annotations specifying variable and function types. Improves code clarity and enables validation.

### Validation
Checking input data meets expected format and constraints before processing. Fail early, fail clearly.
