## What are Triggers?

Triggers automatically execute your Projects in response to events, without manual intervention. Instead of clicking "Execute" every time, set up Triggers to run your Projects when specific conditions are met.

## Types of Triggers

### Webhook Triggers

Execute when an HTTP request hits your webhook endpoint.

**Use cases:**
- Payment notifications (Stripe, PayPal)
- GitHub events (push, PR, issue)
- Form submissions
- Third-party service events

**Setup:**
1. Go to Project → Triggers
2. Click **Add Trigger → Webhook**
3. Configure:
   - Path: `/webhook/payment-received`
   - Authentication: API key or HMAC signature
   - Payload transformation (if needed)
4. Save → Get webhook URL
5. Register URL with external service

**Example URL:**
```
https://app.triform.ai/api/in/31460071-17aa-43e8-a0e6-fb22984c0bdc/26420f15-2143-443f-bca9-45c5b0720784
```

This is an API-call that would trigger a certain flow with the 
{"event": "payment.success", "amount": 99.99, "customer_id": "cust_123"} payload:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://app.triform.ai/api/in/31460071-17aa-43e8-a0e6-fb22984c0bdc/26420f15-2143-443f-bca9-45c5b0720784' \
  --header 'Authorization: 88ffe8398f972837ccc6e0a6cd31c5c92689040c' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"event": "payment.success", "amount": 99.99, "customer_id": "cust_123"}'
```

**Your Project receives:**
```json
{
  "event_type": "payment.success",
  "amount": 99.99,
  "customer_id": "cust_123",
  "received_at": "2025-10-01T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Cron Triggers (Schedule)

Execute at specific times or intervals using native cron scheduling.

**Use cases:**
- Daily reports and summaries
- Periodic data sync and ETL jobs
- Cleanup and maintenance tasks
- Monitoring and health checks
- Scheduled notifications

**Key Features:**
- **Native cron support** — Full cron expression syntax
- **Timezone-aware** — Schedule in your local timezone
- **Reliable execution** — Built-in monitoring and logging
- **Payload mapping** — Pass context data to scheduled runs

**Setup:**
1. Go to Project → Triggers
2. Click **Add Trigger → Cron**
3. Configure:
   - **Cron expression:** `0 6 * * *` (daily at 6 AM)
   - **Timezone:** Select your timezone
   - **Payload:** Define static or dynamic input data
4. Save — Trigger is active immediately

**Schedule types:**

| Type | Cron Expression | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| Every minute | `* * * * *` | Runs every minute |
| Every 15 min | `*/15 * * * *` | Runs at :00, :15, :30, :45 |
| Hourly | `0 * * * *` | Top of each hour |
| Daily at 6 AM | `0 6 * * *` | Every day at 6:00 AM |
| Daily at 9 AM | `0 9 * * *` | Every day at 9:00 AM |
| Weekdays 9 AM | `0 9 * * 1-5` | Monday-Friday at 9:00 AM |
| Weekly Monday | `0 8 * * 1` | Every Monday at 8:00 AM |
| Monthly 1st | `0 0 1 * *` | First of each month at midnight |
| Quarterly | `0 0 1 1,4,7,10 *` | First day of each quarter |

**Cron expression format:**
```
* * * * *
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └─── Day of week (0-7, 0=Sunday)
│ │ │ └───── Month (1-12)
│ │ └─────── Day of month (1-31)
│ └───────── Hour (0-23)
└─────────── Minute (0-59)
```

**Common patterns:**
- `0 * * * *` — Every hour
- `*/15 * * * *` — Every 15 minutes
- `0 9 * * 1-5` — Weekdays at 9 AM
- `0 0 1 * *` — First of each month
- `0 6,18 * * *` — Twice daily at 6 AM and 6 PM
- `0 0 * * 0` — Weekly on Sunday at midnight

**Cron Logging & Monitoring:**

All cron executions are logged with:
- Scheduled time vs actual execution time
- Execution duration and status
- Payload data sent to the flow
- Any errors or warnings

View cron execution history in the Executions Dashboard.

### Manual Triggers

Execute via Execution button.

**Use cases:**
- On-demand processing
- Admin actions
- Testing
- User-initiated workflows


### Viewing Triggers

1. Go to Project → Executions
2. See list of all triggers:
   - Type (webhook, schedule)

### Editing Triggers

1. Select trigger from list
2. Click **Edit**
3. Modify configuration
4. **Save** → Changes take effect immediately

**Note:** Schedule changes apply to future executions, not currently running ones.


### Deleting Triggers

Permanently remove a trigger:

1. Select trigger
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm
4. Trigger is removed

**Warning:** Cannot be undone. Webhook URLs will stop working.

## Trigger configuration

### Payload

Define what data the triggered execution receives.

**Static payload:**
```json
{
  "source": "scheduled_job",
  "timestamp": "{{now}}"
}
```

**Dynamic payload from webhook:**
```json
{
  "event_type": "{{webhook.event}}",
  "data": "{{webhook.body}}",
  "headers": "{{webhook.headers}}"
}
```

**Using variables:**
```json
{
  "api_key": "{{global.API_KEY}}",
  "environment": "{{global.ENV}}"
}
```

### Timeout

Set maximum execution time:

- Default: 60 seconds
- Max: 15 minutes (Pro), 60 minutes (Enterprise)

**If timeout reached:**
- Execution is canceled
- Error logged
- Retry policy applies (if configured)


## Webhook authentication

Secure your webhook endpoints.

### API Key

Require API key in header:

This is an API-call that would trigger a certain flow with the 
{"data": "value"} payload:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://app.triform.ai/api/in/31460071-17aa-43e8-a0e6-fb22984c0bdc/26420f15-2143-443f-bca9-45c5b0720784' \
  --header 'Authorization: 88ffe8398f972837ccc6e0a6cd31c5c92689040c' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"data": "value"}'
```

**Configuration:**
1. Enable API key authentication
2. Provide key to webhook sender
3. Triform validates before execution

## Common patterns

### Pattern 1: Webhook → Process → Notify

```
Webhook receives event
  → Validate and transform
  → Process data
  → Send notification
```

**Example:** Payment received → Update database → Email customer

### Pattern 2: Schedule → Fetch → Process → Store

```
Daily at 6 AM
  → Fetch data from APIs
  → Process and analyze
  → Store results
```

**Example:** Daily report generation

### Pattern 3: Event chain

```
Project A completes
  → Triggers Project B
  → Triggers Project C
```

**Example:** Onboarding flow: Create account → Send welcome → Provision services

### Pattern 4: Error handling

```
Project fails
  → Event trigger fires
  → Error logger Project executes
  → Alert sent to team
```

**Example:** Automated incident response

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Webhook not triggering  
**Solution:** Check URL is correct, authentication is valid, check logs for rejected requests

**Problem:** Schedule not running  
**Solution:** Verify cron expression, check timezone, ensure trigger is not paused

**Problem:** Trigger fires but execution fails  
**Solution:** Check payload format, verify required fields, review execution logs
