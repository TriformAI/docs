## What are Triggers?

Triggers automatically execute your Projects in response to events, without manual intervention. Instead of clicking "Execute" every time, set up Triggers to run your Projects when specific conditions are met.

## Types of Triggers

### Webhook Triggers

Execute when an HTTP request hits your webhook endpoint.

**Use cases:**
- Payment notifications (Stripe, PayPal)
- GitHub events (push, PR, issue)
- Form submissions
- Third-party service events

**Setup:**
1. Go to Project → Triggers
2. Click **Add Trigger → Webhook**
3. Configure:
   - Path: `/webhook/payment-received`
   - Authentication: API key or HMAC signature
   - Payload transformation (if needed)
4. Save → Get webhook URL
5. Register URL with external service

**Example URL:**
```
https://api.triform.ai/v1/webhooks/your-org/payment-received
```

**Incoming webhook:**
```json
POST /v1/webhooks/your-org/payment-received
{
  "event": "payment.success",
  "amount": 99.99,
  "customer_id": "cust_123"
}
```

**Your Project receives:**
```json
{
  "event_type": "payment.success",
  "amount": 99.99,
  "customer_id": "cust_123",
  "received_at": "2025-10-01T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Schedule Triggers

Execute at specific times or intervals.

**Use cases:**
- Daily reports
- Periodic data sync
- Cleanup jobs
- Monitoring checks

**Setup:**
1. Go to Project → Triggers
2. Click **Add Trigger → Schedule**
3. Configure schedule:
   - **Cron expression:** `0 6 * * *` (daily at 6 AM)
   - **Interval:** Every 15 minutes
   - **One-time:** Specific date/time
4. Set timezone
5. Define payload (static or dynamic)
6. Save

**Schedule types:**

| Type | Example | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Cron | `0 6 * * *` | Daily at 6 AM UTC |
| Interval | `Every 15 minutes` | Repeating interval |
| Hourly | `Every hour at :00` | Top of each hour |
| Daily | `Daily at 9:00 AM` | Specific time daily |
| Weekly | `Every Monday at 8:00 AM` | Specific day/time weekly |
| Monthly | `1st of month at 00:00` | Specific day each month |
| One-time | `2025-10-15 14:00:00` | Single execution |

**Cron expression format:**
```
* * * * *
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └─── Day of week (0-7, 0=Sunday)
│ │ │ └───── Month (1-12)
│ │ └─────── Day of month (1-31)
│ └───────── Hour (0-23)
└─────────── Minute (0-59)
```

**Common patterns:**
- `0 * * * *` — Every hour
- `*/15 * * * *` — Every 15 minutes
- `0 9 * * 1-5` — Weekdays at 9 AM
- `0 0 1 * *` — First of each month

### Manual Triggers

Execute via button or API call.

**Use cases:**
- On-demand processing
- Admin actions
- Testing
- User-initiated workflows

**Setup:**
1. Default for all Projects
2. Execute via:
   - UI Execute button
   - API call
   - CLI command

**API call:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.triform.ai/v1/projects/your-project/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"user_id": "123"}'
```

### Event Triggers

Execute when specific events occur within Triform.

**Use cases:**
- Chain Projects together
- Respond to execution failures
- Auto-remediation
- Notifications

**Setup:**
1. Go to Project → Triggers
2. Click **Add Trigger → Event**
3. Select event type:
   - Project execution completed
   - Execution failed
   - Deployment succeeded
   - Variable updated
4. Filter conditions (optional)
5. Define payload
6. Save

**Example: Error notification**
- Event: Any execution failed
- Filter: Project = "Customer Onboarding"
- Action: Execute "Send Alert" Project

## Managing Triggers

### Viewing Triggers

1. Go to Project → Triggers
2. See list of all triggers:
   - Type (webhook, schedule, event)
   - Status (active, paused, disabled)
   - Last triggered
   - Success rate

### Editing Triggers

1. Select trigger from list
2. Click **Edit**
3. Modify configuration
4. **Save** → Changes take effect immediately

**Note:** Schedule changes apply to future executions, not currently running ones.

### Pausing Triggers

Temporarily stop a trigger without deleting it:

1. Select trigger
2. Click **Pause**
3. Trigger stops executing
4. Click **Resume** to reactivate

**Use cases:**
- During maintenance
- Troubleshooting
- Temporarily disable feature

### Deleting Triggers

Permanently remove a trigger:

1. Select trigger
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm
4. Trigger is removed

**Warning:** Cannot be undone. Webhook URLs will stop working.

## Trigger configuration

### Payload

Define what data the triggered execution receives.

**Static payload:**
```json
{
  "source": "scheduled_job",
  "timestamp": "{{now}}"
}
```

**Dynamic payload from webhook:**
```json
{
  "event_type": "{{webhook.event}}",
  "data": "{{webhook.body}}",
  "headers": "{{webhook.headers}}"
}
```

**Using variables:**
```json
{
  "api_key": "{{global.API_KEY}}",
  "environment": "{{global.ENV}}"
}
```

### Retry policy

Configure what happens on failure.

**Options:**
- **No retry** — Fail and move on
- **Retry with backoff** — Try again with increasing delays
- **Fixed retry** — Retry N times with fixed delay

**Example:**
- Max retries: 3
- Initial delay: 5 seconds
- Backoff multiplier: 2 (5s, 10s, 20s)

### Timeout

Set maximum execution time:

- Default: 30 seconds
- Max: 15 minutes (Pro), 60 minutes (Enterprise)

**If timeout reached:**
- Execution is canceled
- Error logged
- Retry policy applies (if configured)

### Concurrency

Control how many executions can run simultaneously.

**Options:**
- **Unlimited** — No limit (default)
- **Limited** — Max N concurrent executions
- **Serial** — One at a time (queue others)

**Use serial for:**
- Order-dependent operations
- Resource constraints
- Rate limit compliance

## Webhook authentication

Secure your webhook endpoints.

### API Key

Require API key in header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.triform.ai/v1/webhooks/your-endpoint \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"data": "value"}'
```

**Configuration:**
1. Enable API key authentication
2. Provide key to webhook sender
3. Triform validates before execution

### HMAC Signature

Verify request came from expected source:

**How it works:**
1. Sender signs payload with shared secret
2. Includes signature in header
3. Triform recomputes and verifies

**Example (Stripe-style):**
```python
import hmac
import hashlib

payload = '{"event": "payment.success"}'
secret = "your_webhook_secret"

signature = hmac.new(
    secret.encode(),
    payload.encode(),
    hashlib.sha256
).hexdigest()

# Include in request header
headers = {
    "X-Webhook-Signature": signature
}
```

**Configuration:**
1. Enable HMAC authentication
2. Set shared secret
3. Configure header name (e.g., `X-Webhook-Signature`)
4. Triform validates before execution

### IP Allowlist

Restrict to specific IP addresses:

**Configuration:**
1. Enable IP allowlist
2. Add allowed IPs: `203.0.113.1`, `203.0.113.2`
3. Requests from other IPs are rejected

**Use case:** Known, fixed-IP services (internal systems, specific vendors)

## Monitoring Triggers

### Trigger dashboard

View trigger performance:

- **Executions today** — Count
- **Success rate** — Percentage
- **Avg duration** — Time
- **Errors** — Types and counts

### Alerts

Set up notifications:

**Alert conditions:**
- Success rate drops below 90%
- Execution takes longer than 1 minute
- Webhook returns error 3+ times
- Schedule misses execution

**Notification channels:**
- Email
- Slack
- Discord
- Webhook (meta!)
- PagerDuty (Enterprise)

### Logs

All trigger executions are logged:

1. Go to Project → Executions
2. Filter by trigger type
3. View execution details

**Webhook-specific logs:**
- Incoming payload
- Headers received
- IP address
- Timestamp
- Response sent

## Best practices

> **Secure webhooks** — Always use authentication (API key or HMAC)

> **Handle failures gracefully** — Configure retries for transient errors

> **Log extensively** — Track all trigger executions for debugging

> **Test thoroughly** — Verify triggers work before going live

> **Monitor actively** — Set up alerts for failures

> **Document webhooks** — Note what sends them and expected format

> **Use idempotency** — Handle duplicate webhook deliveries

> **Rate limit** — Protect against webhook floods

## Common patterns

### Pattern 1: Webhook → Process → Notify

```
Webhook receives event
  → Validate and transform
  → Process data
  → Send notification
```

**Example:** Payment received → Update database → Email customer

### Pattern 2: Schedule → Fetch → Process → Store

```
Daily at 6 AM
  → Fetch data from APIs
  → Process and analyze
  → Store results
```

**Example:** Daily report generation

### Pattern 3: Event chain

```
Project A completes
  → Triggers Project B
  → Triggers Project C
```

**Example:** Onboarding flow: Create account → Send welcome → Provision services

### Pattern 4: Error handling

```
Project fails
  → Event trigger fires
  → Error logger Project executes
  → Alert sent to team
```

**Example:** Automated incident response

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Webhook not triggering  
**Solution:** Check URL is correct, authentication is valid, check logs for rejected requests

**Problem:** Schedule not running  
**Solution:** Verify cron expression, check timezone, ensure trigger is not paused

**Problem:** Trigger fires but execution fails  
**Solution:** Check payload format, verify required fields, review execution logs

**Problem:** Too many concurrent executions  
**Solution:** Enable serial execution or set concurrency limit

**Problem:** Webhook receiving duplicates  
**Solution:** Implement idempotency checks using unique event IDs
