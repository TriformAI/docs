## Anatomy

- Prompts
  - System Prompt — Non‑negotiable instructions.
  - Messages List (toggle) — Pass conversation history as input/output.
  - User Prompt — Optional pre‑set prompt for fixed‑purpose Agents.
- Model configuration — Provider/model, temperature, top‑p, max tokens.
- Toolbox — The set of callable tools made available to the Agent.

## Good patterns

- Keep System Prompts specific and outcome‑oriented.
- Start with few high‑leverage tools; expand gradually.
- Use Messages List when memory/context matters.

## Observability

- Executions emit logs, traces, metrics for inspection.
- Use Payloads to reproduce and compare runs after prompt changes.

> tip: Tool hygiene — Name tools by verb + object (`fetch_user`, `summarize_text`). Small, predictable tools make plans more reliable.
