## Anatomy

- Prompts
  - System Prompt — Non‑negotiable instructions.
  - Messages List (toggle) — Pass conversation history as input/output.
  - User Prompt — Optional pre‑set prompt for fixed‑purpose Agents.
- Model configuration — Provider/model, temperature, top‑p, max tokens.
- Toolbox — The set of callable tools made available to the Agent.

## Good patterns

- Keep System Prompts specific and outcome‑oriented.
- Start with few high‑leverage tools; expand gradually.
- Use Messages List when memory/context matters.
- Leverage enhanced tool calling for more reliable agent operations.

## Enhanced capabilities

Recent improvements to the Agent system:

- **Improved tool calling** — More reliable tool usage with better error handling
- **Execution visibility** — Real-time execution steps sent to UI for debugging
- **Better prompts** — Refined prompt system for clearer agent guidance
- **Loop support in tools** — Agent tools can now use iterative operations

## Observability

- Executions emit logs, traces, metrics for inspection.
- Use Payloads to reproduce and compare runs after prompt changes.
- Monitor execution steps in real-time through the chat interface.

> tip: Tool hygiene — Name tools by verb + object (`fetch_user`, `summarize_text`). Small, predictable tools make plans more reliable.
