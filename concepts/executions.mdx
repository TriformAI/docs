## How executions start

- Manual — Run from Properties → Execute.
- API/Schedule — Triggered externally (for exposed top‑level Nodes).
- Internal — Invoked by another Node within a Flow.

## Characteristics

- Isolated — No shared state between runs.
- Reproducible — Inputs, modifiers, and context are logged.
- Traceable — Inspect logs, traces, and metrics historically.
- Evaluated — Optionally score outputs with Evaluations.
- **Real-time visibility** — Execution steps are sent to the UI for live monitoring and debugging.

## Flow of an execution

1. Trigger — Manual, schedule, or API.
2. Input — JSON payload (from trigger or saved Payload).
3. Process — Node(s) execute and pass data along Edges.
4. Output — Result returned or stored.

## Execution visibility

Recent improvements provide enhanced debugging capabilities:

- **Step-by-step tracking** — See each execution step as it happens in real-time
- **Builder context integration** — Execution data is integrated into the builder for better debugging
- **Error tracing** — Agent-friendly error messages help identify and resolve issues quickly

## Practical tips

- Save Payloads for common scenarios.
- Keep inputs small and typed for easier regression.
- Use consistent correlation fields to stitch traces across components.
- Monitor execution steps in the UI to debug issues as they occur.

> note: Parallelism — For components with Parallel ON, provide a list of inputs; each item is executed concurrently and aggregated downstream.
