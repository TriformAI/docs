## What is an Execution?

An Execution is a single run of a Project, Flow, Agent, or Action. Every time you trigger a component, Triform creates an Execution record that tracks:

- Input payload
- Output results
- Execution path taken
- Timing for each step
- Logs and errors
- Resource usage

## Why Executions matter

Executions provide:

**Observability** — See exactly what happened  
**Debugging** — Trace errors to their source  
**Performance** — Identify slow components  
**Compliance** — Audit trail of all runs  
**Testing** — Replay with saved payloads

## Viewing Executions

### In the UI

1. Open your Project/Flow/Agent/Action
2. Go to **Properties → Executions**
3. See list of recent executions

**Each entry shows:**
- Execution ID
- Timestamp
- Status (success, failed, running)
- Duration
- Input/output preview

### Execution details

Click an execution to see:

**Overview tab:**
- Status and result
- Start and end time
- Total duration
- Input and output payloads

**Trace tab:**
- Execution graph showing path taken
- Node-by-node timing
- Data flow between nodes

**Logs tab:**
- Debug, info, warning, error logs
- Timestamps for each log entry
- Source component for each log

**Metrics tab:**
- Token usage (for Agents)
- API calls made
- Memory usage
- Cost breakdown

## Execution statuses

### Running

Execution is currently in progress.

**Visual:** Yellow indicator  
**Actions:** Can cancel if needed  
**View:** Live logs updating

### Completed

Execution finished successfully.

**Visual:** Green indicator  
**Result:** Output available  
**View:** Full logs and metrics

### Failed

Execution encountered an error.

**Visual:** Red indicator  
**Error:** Details in logs  
**Actions:** Debug, retry, or fix

### Canceled

Execution was manually stopped.

**Visual:** Gray indicator  
**Partial:** May have partial results  
**Reason:** User-initiated or timeout

### Timeout

Execution exceeded time limit.

**Visual:** Orange indicator  
**Reason:** Configured timeout reached  
**Actions:** Increase timeout or optimize

## Execution trace

The trace shows the path taken through your Flow.

### Reading the trace

**Graph visualization:**
```
Input (0.1s)
  ↓
Validate (0.3s) ✓
  ↓
Process (5.2s) ✓
  ↓
Format (0.4s) ✓
  ↓
Output (0.1s)
```

**Node colors:**
- **Green** — Executed successfully
- **Red** — Failed
- **Gray** — Skipped
- **Yellow** — Currently running

### Inspecting nodes in trace

Click a node to see:
- Input received
- Output produced
- Logs from that step
- Execution time
- Errors (if any)

### Understanding data flow

Edges show data movement:

**Bold edges** — Data flowed through  
**Gray edges** — Not used (conditional paths)  
**Red edges** — Error path taken

## Execution logs

### Log levels

**Debug** — Detailed information for troubleshooting  
**Info** — General informational messages  
**Warning** — Something unexpected but not breaking  
**Error** — Failures and exceptions

### Filtering logs

- By level (show only errors)
- By component (logs from specific Action)
- By time range
- By keyword search

### Common log patterns

**Successful execution:**
```
[INFO] Execution started: exec_abc123
[INFO] Input validated successfully
[DEBUG] Fetching data from API
[DEBUG] Received 42 items
[INFO] Processing completed
[INFO] Execution completed in 3.2s
```

**Failed execution:**
```
[INFO] Execution started: exec_xyz789
[INFO] Input validated successfully
[DEBUG] Fetching data from API
[ERROR] ConnectionError: Failed to connect to api.example.com
[ERROR] Execution failed in process_data Action
```

## Execution metrics

### Performance metrics

**Duration** — Total execution time  
**Wait time** — Time in queue before starting  
**Processing time** — Active computation time  
**I/O time** — Network and database operations

### Resource metrics

**Token usage** — For LLM calls (Agents)  
**API calls** — External service requests  
**Memory** — Peak memory usage  
**Storage** — Data written/read

### Cost metrics

**LLM costs** — GPT-4, Claude, etc. usage  
**API costs** — Third-party service fees  
**Compute costs** — Execution resource usage  
**Total cost** — Sum of all costs

## Replaying Executions

Re-run an execution with the same input.

### Why replay?

- Test fixes for failed executions
- Validate optimizations
- Compare performance before/after changes
- Regression testing

### How to replay

1. Open execution details
2. Click **Replay**
3. Optionally modify input
4. Click **Execute**
5. New execution starts with same/modified input

### Comparing executions

Compare two executions side-by-side:

1. Select first execution
2. Click **Compare**
3. Select second execution
4. View differences:
   - Input/output changes
   - Timing differences
   - Different paths taken
   - Error variations

## Execution history

### Viewing history

**Recent executions** — Last 100 runs (default)  
**Date range** — Custom time period  
**Filtered** — By status, user, or component

### History patterns

**Success rate over time:**
```
Last 24 hours: 95% (190/200)
Last 7 days:   92% (1,288/1,400)
Last 30 days:  94% (5,640/6,000)
```

**Performance trends:**
```
Average duration:
Today:     3.2s
This week: 3.5s
This month: 3.1s
```

**Common errors:**
```
TimeoutError: 15 occurrences
ValidationError: 8 occurrences
APIError: 3 occurrences
```

## Debugging with Executions

### Scenario 1: Find why it failed

1. Filter by status: Failed
2. Find relevant execution
3. Open trace
4. Identify red node
5. Check logs for that node
6. Read error message
7. Fix the issue

### Scenario 2: Find performance bottleneck

1. Open execution details
2. View trace with timing
3. Identify slowest node
4. Check what it's doing
5. Optimize (caching, parallelization, etc.)

### Scenario 3: Understand unexpected output

1. Open execution
2. Trace data flow
3. Click each node to see input/output
4. Find where data diverged from expected
5. Fix transformation or mapping

### Scenario 4: Intermittent failures

1. Filter to failed executions
2. Compare with successful ones
3. Look for patterns:
   - Time of day?
   - Input size?
   - Specific values?
4. Identify and fix root cause

## Execution retention

### Retention periods

**Free tier:** 7 days  
**Pro tier:** 30 days  
**Enterprise:** 90 days or custom

**After retention period:**
- Execution details deleted
- Summary stats retained
- Can't replay or view logs

### Archiving important executions

**Mark as important:**
1. Open execution
2. Click star icon
3. Execution won't be deleted

**Export for long-term storage:**
1. Select execution(s)
2. Click Export
3. Save JSON locally or to S3

## Execution API

Access executions programmatically.

### List executions

```bash
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/executions
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "executions": [
    {
      "id": "exec_abc123",
      "status": "completed",
      "duration_ms": 3200,
      "started_at": "2025-10-01T10:30:00Z",
      "completed_at": "2025-10-01T10:30:03Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Get execution details

```bash
GET /v1/executions/{execution_id}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "exec_abc123",
  "status": "completed",
  "input": {"user_id": "123"},
  "output": {"result": "success"},
  "trace": [...],
  "logs": [...],
  "metrics": {...}
}
```

### Cancel execution

```bash
POST /v1/executions/{execution_id}/cancel
```

## Best practices

> **Log liberally** — Info for checkpoints, debug for details

> **Use structured logs** — Include context (user_id, request_id)

> **Monitor success rates** — Set up alerts for drops

> **Review failed executions** — Don't let errors accumulate

> **Replay for testing** — Use real data for regression tests

> **Archive important runs** — Star critical executions

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Can't find an execution  
**Solution:** Check date filters, ensure you're in the right Project

**Problem:** Execution shows "running" but isn't progressing  
**Solution:** May be stuck; cancel and retry. Check logs for where it stopped.

**Problem:** Execution logs are empty  
**Solution:** Check if logging is enabled in component settings

**Problem:** Execution trace doesn't show all nodes  
**Solution:** Some nodes may have been skipped due to conditional logic
