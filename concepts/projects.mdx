## What is a Project?

A Project is a complete, deployable AI system in Triform. It's a repository that holds all the components (Agents, Flows, Actions) needed to accomplish a specific goal.

## Project structure

Projects contain:

**Actions** — Python functions for deterministic logic  
**Agents** — LLM-powered components with tools  
**Flows** — Orchestration graphs connecting components  
**Sub-Projects** — Nested Projects for modularity  
**Variables** — Configuration accessible to all components  
**Triggers** — What starts executions

Example structure:
```
Project: Customer Support System
├── Flows
│   ├── ticket_triage
│   └── response_generation
├── Agents
│   ├── sentiment_analyzer
│   └── response_writer
├── Actions
│   ├── fetch_ticket
│   ├── update_status
│   └── send_notification
└── Project Variables
    ├── API_KEYS
    └── CONFIG
```

## Creating Projects

### Via UI

1. Click **Home** in Top Bar
2. Click **New Project**
3. Name it and add a description
4. Click **Create**

### Via Triton

Ask: _"Create a new Project for processing customer feedback"_

Triton will create the structure, ask clarifying questions, and suggest initial components.

## Working with Projects

### Opening and navigating

1. Navigate to **Home**
2. Click your Project to open on Canvas
3. **Double-click** nodes to drill into Flows, Agents, or Actions
4. Use **breadcrumbs** at top to track your location

### Building in a Project

**Via Triton:**
- _"Add a validation Flow to this Project"_
- _"Create an Action that calls the Stripe API"_

**Via UI:**
- Right-click Canvas → Add Node
- Choose component type, configure, and connect

## Project lifecycle

**1. Design** — Plan inputs, outputs, and data flow  
**2. Build** — Create Actions, configure Agents, build Flows  
**3. Integrate** — Wire components together  
**4. Test** — Validate with sample payloads  
**5. Deploy** — Push to staging, then production  
**6. Monitor** — Track execution success rate and performance  
**7. Iterate** — Add features and optimize

## Common patterns

### Request-Response API
```
Input → Validate → Process → Format → Output
```
Use case: API endpoints, data transformations

### Multi-stage pipeline
```
Input → Extract → Transform → Load → Output
```
Use case: ETL, data processing, content generation

### Agent with tools
```
Input (query) → Agent (with tools) → Output (response)
  Tools: search_database, call_api, send_email
```
Use case: Conversational interfaces, decision support

### Parallel processing
```
Input → Split → [Process A, B, C] → Merge → Output
```
Use case: High-volume processing, independent tasks

## Best practices

> **Single responsibility** — Each Project should have one clear purpose

> **Self-contained** — Minimize dependencies on other Projects

> **Well-documented** — Clear descriptions for all components

> **Tested** — Save example payloads for regression testing

> **Monitored** — Track success rates and performance

## Project scope guidelines

**Too small** ❌  
Project: "Uppercase a string" → Should be an Action

**Just right** ✅  
Project: "User Onboarding" → Includes validation, account creation, welcome email, setup

**Too large** ❌  
Project: "Entire Customer Platform" → Split into multiple Projects: Support, Billing, Notifications

**Rule of thumb:** If you can't explain what the Project does in one sentence, it's too large.

## Troubleshooting

**Project won't deploy**  
Check all components are configured, Project Variables are set, no circular dependencies

**Execution fails in Project but components work individually**  
Check connections, field mappings, and data flow

**Project is slow**  
Profile execution, identify bottlenecks, add parallel processing or caching

**Can't find my Project**  
Check filters, search by name, verify you're in the right Organization
