## What is a Project?

A Project is a complete, deployable AI system in Triform. It's a container that holds all the components (Agents, Flows, Actions) needed to accomplish a specific goal.

Think of a Project as:
- A **microservice** for AI workloads
- A **package** of related functionality
- A **deployable unit** with its own API endpoint

## Project structure

### Components

Projects contain:

**Actions** — Python functions for deterministic logic  
**Agents** — LLM-powered components with tools  
**Flows** — Orchestration graphs connecting components  
**Sub-Projects** — Nested Projects for modularity

### Organization

```
Project: Customer Support System
├── Flows
│   ├── ticket_triage
│   └── response_generation
├── Agents
│   ├── sentiment_analyzer
│   └── response_writer
├── Actions
│   ├── fetch_ticket
│   ├── update_status
│   └── send_notification
└── Global Variables
    ├── API_KEYS
    └── CONFIG
```

## Creating Projects

### Via UI

1. Click **Home** in Top Bar
2. Click **New Project**
3. Name it: `Customer Support System`
4. Add description: `Automated ticket triage and response`
5. Click **Create**

### Via Triton

Ask: _"Create a new Project for processing customer feedback"_

Triton will:
- Create the Project structure
- Ask clarifying questions
- Suggest initial components
- Set up basic configuration

### From template

Start with common patterns:

- **Data Processing Pipeline** — ETL workflows
- **Customer Support** — Ticket handling
- **Content Generation** — Writing and editing
- **Research Assistant** — Information gathering
- **API Integration** — Connect external services

Select template → Customize → Deploy

## Project properties

### Basic information

**Name** — Unique identifier within Organization  
**Description** — What this Project does  
**Tags** — Categorization (e.g., `production`, `customer-facing`, `experimental`)  
**Owner** — Person or team responsible

### Configuration

**Global Variables** — Environment-specific values  
**API Keys** — Credentials for external services  
**Quotas** — Resource limits  
**Permissions** — Who can view/edit/execute

### Deployment settings

**Entry point** — Which Flow to expose as API  
**Authentication** — API key, OAuth, or public  
**Rate limiting** — Requests per minute/hour  
**Timeout** — Maximum execution time

## Working with Projects

### Opening a Project

1. Navigate to **Home**
2. Find your Project in the list
3. Click to open on Canvas

You'll see the Project's component graph.

### Navigating within

**Double-click** nodes to drill into:
- Flows — See internal structure
- Agents — View configuration
- Actions — Edit code

**Breadcrumbs** at top show current location.

### Building in a Project

Add components:

**Via Triton:**
- _"Add a validation Flow to this Project"_
- _"Create an Action that calls the Stripe API"_

**Via UI:**
- Right-click Canvas → Add Node
- Choose component type
- Configure and connect

**Via Toolbox:**
- Drag existing components from Agent Toolbox
- Position and wire up

## Project lifecycle

### 1. Design

Plan the system:
- Define inputs and outputs
- Identify required components
- Sketch data flow
- Consider error handling

### 2. Build

Create components:
- Write Actions for specific tasks
- Configure Agents for decision-making
- Build Flows to orchestrate
- Test individually

### 3. Integrate

Connect components:
- Wire Flows
- Map data between nodes
- Handle errors gracefully
- Add logging

### 4. Test

Validate functionality:
- Test with sample payloads
- Check edge cases
- Monitor execution logs
- Iterate and fix

### 5. Deploy

Make it live:
- Configure deployment settings
- Set environment variables
- Deploy to staging first
- Test in staging
- Deploy to production

### 6. Monitor

Watch it run:
- Track execution success rate
- Monitor performance
- Set up alerts
- Review logs regularly

### 7. Iterate

Improve over time:
- Add features
- Optimize performance
- Fix bugs
- Update based on feedback

## Project best practices

> **Single responsibility** — Each Project should have one clear purpose

> **Self-contained** — Minimize dependencies on other Projects

> **Well-documented** — Clear descriptions for all components

> **Tested** — Save example payloads for regression testing

> **Monitored** — Track success rates and performance

> **Versioned** — Use meaningful names and descriptions when updating

## Project patterns

### Pattern 1: Request-Response API

**Structure:**
```
Input (API request)
  → Validate
  → Process
  → Format
  → Output (API response)
```

**Use case:** Simple API endpoints, data transformations

**Example:** Currency converter, text summarizer

### Pattern 2: Multi-stage pipeline

**Structure:**
```
Input
  → Stage 1 (Extract)
  → Stage 2 (Transform)
  → Stage 3 (Load)
  → Output
```

**Use case:** ETL, data processing, content generation

**Example:** News aggregator, report generator

### Pattern 3: Agent with tools

**Structure:**
```
Input (user query)
  → Agent (with tools)
      ├── Tool 1: search_database
      ├── Tool 2: call_api
      └── Tool 3: send_email
  → Output (agent response)
```

**Use case:** Conversational interfaces, decision support

**Example:** Customer support bot, research assistant

### Pattern 4: Parallel processing

**Structure:**
```
Input
  → Split
      ├── Process A
      ├── Process B
      └── Process C
  → Merge
  → Output
```

**Use case:** High-volume processing, independent tasks

**Example:** Batch image processing, multi-source data collection

### Pattern 5: Event-driven workflow

**Structure:**
```
Trigger (webhook, schedule)
  → Route by event type
      ├── Type A → Handler A
      ├── Type B → Handler B
      └── Type C → Handler C
  → Log and notify
```

**Use case:** Webhooks, scheduled jobs, event processing

**Example:** Payment processor, notification system

## Project scope guidelines

### Too small (anti-pattern)

❌ Project: "Uppercase a string"  
→ This should be an Action within a larger Project

❌ Project: "Validate email"  
→ This should be an Action

### Just right

✅ Project: "User Onboarding"  
→ Includes validation, account creation, welcome email, setup

✅ Project: "Content Moderation"  
→ Includes detection, classification, action, notification

### Too large (anti-pattern)

❌ Project: "Entire Customer Platform"  
→ Split into multiple Projects: Support, Billing, Notifications, etc.

**Rule of thumb:** If you can't explain what the Project does in one sentence, it's too large.

## Sharing and collaboration

### Within Organization

All Organization members can:
- View Projects (if permissions allow)
- Edit Projects (if editor/admin)
- Execute Projects (if permissions allow)

### Inviting teammates

1. Go to Organization → Members
2. Invite by email
3. Assign role (Viewer, Editor, Admin)
4. They can now access Projects

### Project-specific permissions

Fine-grained control:

- **Viewer** — Can view but not edit
- **Editor** — Can edit and test
- **Deployer** — Can deploy to staging/production
- **Admin** — Full control

## Versioning Projects

While Triform auto-saves, consider:

### Naming conventions

- `customer-support-v1`
- `customer-support-v2` (major changes)

### Exporting snapshots

1. Right-click Project → Export
2. Save JSON locally
3. Use as backup or for version control

### Git integration (if enabled)

- Connect Organization to GitHub
- Projects sync to repo
- Use branches for features
- Pull requests for review

## Deleting Projects

**Caution:** Deletion is permanent.

1. Open Project
2. Project menu → Delete
3. Confirm by typing Project name
4. Project and all components are removed

**Before deleting:**
- Export as backup
- Check if used by other Projects
- Notify team
- Verify no production traffic

## Migrating Projects

### Between Environments

Export from dev → Import to staging → Test → Import to production

### Between Organizations

1. Export Project from Org A
2. Share JSON file
3. Import into Org B
4. Update environment-specific variables

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Project won't deploy  
**Solution:** Check all components are configured, Global Variables are set, no circular dependencies

**Problem:** Execution fails in Project but components work individually  
**Solution:** Check connections, field mappings, and data flow

**Problem:** Project is slow  
**Solution:** Profile execution, identify bottlenecks, add parallel processing or caching

**Problem:** Can't find my Project  
**Solution:** Check filters (All vs. Favorites), search by name, verify you're in the right Organization
