description: "Atomic Python units: structure, contracts, workflow"

## Structure

- Action.py — Implementation.
- README — Purpose, I/O, examples.
- requirements.txt — Pure‑Python dependencies (no binary installs).

## Contract

- Inputs — Typed, minimal, documented.
- Outputs — Deterministic structure; document edge cases.

## Workflow

1. Define input/output and write `Action.py`.
2. Pin dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
3. Test with small Payloads via Execute.
4. Reuse across Flows and as Agent tools.

## Loop Support

Actions now support iterative execution with loops:

- **For loops** — Iterate over collections and lists
- **While loops** — Continue until a condition is met
- **Loop state management** — Proper handling of iteration context and variables

This allows Actions to handle batch processing, repeated operations, and conditional iterations natively.

## OAuth Integration

Actions can access OAuth credentials for third-party API integrations:

```python
from triform import get_oauth_token

def my_action(data: dict) -> dict:
    # Access OAuth token configured via modifiers
    token = get_oauth_token('google')
    
    # Use in API requests
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token.access_token}'}
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', headers=headers)
    
    return response.json()
```

**Supported features:**
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Secure credential injection at runtime
- Multi-provider support (Google, GitHub, Slack, Microsoft, etc.)
- Token management handled by the platform

See [Modifiers](/concepts/modifiers) for configuring OAuth credentials.

> warning: Dependencies — Only packages that do not require binary installs in the build image are supported.
