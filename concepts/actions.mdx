## Structure

- Action.py — Implementation.
- README — Purpose, I/O, examples.
- requirements.txt — Pure‑Python dependencies (no binary installs).

## Contract

- Inputs — Typed, minimal, documented.
- Outputs — Deterministic structure; document edge cases.

## Workflow

1. Define input/output and write `Action.py`.
2. Pin dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
3. Test with small Payloads via Execute.
4. Reuse across Flows and as Agent tools.

## Loop Support

Actions now support iterative execution with loops:

- **For loops** — Iterate over collections and lists
- **While loops** — Continue until a condition is met
- **Loop state management** — Proper handling of iteration context and variables

This allows Actions to handle batch processing, repeated operations, and conditional iterations natively.

> warning: Dependencies — Only packages that do not require binary installs in the build image are supported.
