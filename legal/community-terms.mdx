# Triform Community Version Terms

**Effective date:** October 9, 2025  
**Entity:** Triform AB, Götgatan 23, 116 46 Stockholm, Sweden  
**Contact:** contact@triform.ai

> **Summary (not a substitute for the terms):** Your **creations and source code are public**. Your **executions, inputs, and outputs are not shared**; Triform may use **de-identified** execution data to operate, improve, and train systems and models. Use **secret variables** for credentials or sensitive values.

## 1) Eligibility
- You must be **16+** (or the age of digital consent in your country, if higher).  
- If you use Triform on behalf of an organization, you confirm you have authority to accept these terms.

## 2) Definitions
- **Creations**: your project assets that you intentionally publish to the project workspace, including **source code**, prompts, configs, docs, and non-secret assets.  
- **Execution Data**: runtime data from building/running agents (e.g., inputs, outputs, logs, traces, error messages, metrics).  
- **Secret Data**: values you pass via secret variables/inputs (e.g., API keys, credentials, personal data).

## 3) What is public vs. private
- **Public:** Your **Creations (source code and non-secret assets)** are **public by default** and visible to anyone.  
- **Not shared publicly:** **Execution Data** and **Secret Data** are **not disclosed to the public** by Triform.

## 4) MIT-Licenses for public Creations (code)
- **License to the public:** By using the Community Version, you grant everyone a **worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual license** to **use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, and distribute** your **public code/Creations**, including commercially, with **reasonable attribution** (your Triform handle + project URL).
- **License to Triform:** You grant Triform a matching license to host, display, index, remix, and showcase your public Creations and to use them to operate and improve the service.

## 5) Use of Execution Data for training (private to the public)
- Triform may **process and use Execution Data** to operate, secure, evaluate, and **train/improve** our systems and models.  
- **PII cleaning/anonymization:** Before any training or analysis use, we **remove or transform personally identifiable data** and **exclude Secret Data** (e.g., secret variables, credentials). We do **not** intentionally include raw secrets in training corpora.  
- We do **not** publish or disclose Execution Data to the public. We do **not** attempt to re-identify de-identified data.  
- If you delete a project, we stop using it for future training. Already-trained models may not be retroactively "untrained." Backups may persist for a limited period for security/compliance.

## 6) Your responsibilities
- Do not upload or hard-code secrets; use **secret variables**.  
- Only include materials you have rights to share **publicly** in your Creations (e.g., your own code).  
- Do not use Triform for illegal, infringing, abusive, or harmful activities, or to violate third-party API/model terms.

## 7) Moderation; reporting
- We may remove content, restrict access, or take action where these terms or the law are violated.  
- Report issues or request takedown at **report@triform.ai** (include project URL and reason).

## 8) Service changes
The Community Version is provided **as-is** without SLA. We may change or discontinue features. If we make **material changes** to these terms, we will notify you and update the effective date.

## 9) Disclaimers; liability
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TRIFORM IS NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS/REVENUE/DATA/GOODWILL. DIRECT DAMAGES ARE LIMITED TO **€100**.

## 10) Governing law; arbitration
These terms are governed by the laws of **Sweden**. Any disputes arising from these terms shall be resolved through **binding arbitration in Stockholm, Sweden** in accordance with the rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.
