> **Document ownership** — Assign clear owners

> **Set up alerts** — Proactive problem detection

> **Review costs monthly** — Optimize expensive Projects

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Can't find a Project  
**Solution:** Check filters (archived/active), search by owner, verify you're in correct Organization

**Problem:** Can't open a Project  
**Solution:** Check permissions, ensure you have at least Viewer role

**Problem:** Project shows error status  
**Solution:** Open Project, check recent executions, review logs

**Problem:** Metrics not updating  
**Solution:** Refresh page, check if Project has recent executions
