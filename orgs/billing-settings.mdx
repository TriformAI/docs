# Billing & Settings

Organization Owners manage billing and Org‑wide settings.

## Billing
- View current plan and usage.
- Update payment method and invoices.
- Adjust limits by selecting a different tier when available.

## Settings
- Visibility — Public/Private defaults for new components (default: public).
- Licensing — Default license applied to components created under the Org.
- Integrations — Manage linked services (e.g., GitHub).

> tip: Audit periodically — Review visibility, licenses, and integrations quarterly to align with policy changes.
