# Roles & Permissions

Each user in an Organization has one of three roles.

| Role | Permissions |
|-------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access, including billing, GitHub linking, and user removal. |
| **Admin** | Manage Nodes, Projects, and users (except removing Owners). |
| **Member** | Create/edit/run Nodes; cannot manage users or billing. |

## Guidance
- Keep the number of Owners small.
- Promote trusted Members to Admin for day‑to‑day management.
- Review roles quarterly.

> tip: Principle of least privilege — Grant only the access required to perform the job effectively.
