## Prerequisites

- A Discord or GitHub account
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

## Step 1: Sign in

1. Navigate to [app.triform.ai](https://app.triform.ai)
2. Click **Sign in with Discord** or **Sign in with GitHub**
3. Authorize Triform to access your account
4. You'll be redirected to your workspace

## Step 2: Explore your workspace

When you first log in, you'll see:

- **Top Bar** — Navigation, breadcrumbs, and deploy controls
- **Canvas** — The visual workspace where you build
- **Chat Panel** — Triton, your AI assistant
- **Properties Panel** — Configuration and execution controls

## Step 3: Create your first Flow

Let's build a simple workflow using Triton:

1. Click in the **Chat Panel** at the bottom
2. Type: _"Build me a Flow that gives me a summary of the latest news from HackerNews"_
3. Watch as Triton:
   - Plans the structure
   - Creates the necessary components
   - Connects them together

## Step 4: Execute your Flow

1. Select the Flow node on the Canvas
2. Open the **Properties Panel** on the right
3. Navigate to the **Execute** tab
4. Enter a test payload:
   ```json
   {
     "text": "hello world"
   }
   ```
5. Click **Execute**
6. View the results in the output panel

## Step 5: Explore further

Now that you've created and executed your first Flow, try:

- **Modifying the Flow** — Add more Actions or Agents
- **Creating an Agent** — Ask Triton to build a tool-using Agent
- **Viewing Executions** — Check the execution history for your Flow
- **Deploying** — Make your Flow accessible via API
