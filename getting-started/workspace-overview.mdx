## Two workspaces

Triform has two main workspaces, each optimized for different activities:

### Chat Workspace

**For using and interacting with your agents**

- Conversational interface for talking with agents
- Chat history to manage conversations
- Project selector to enable agent capabilities
- Similar experience to ChatGPT or other chat tools

### Builder Workspace

**For designing and building your AI systems**

- Visual Canvas where you compose nodes and flows
- Chat Panel with Triton, your AI building assistant
- Properties Panel for configuration and execution
- Tools for creating and debugging components

## Top Bar

The top bar is shared across both workspaces and provides:
- **Workspace switcher** — Toggle between Chat and Builder
- **Navigation** — Breadcrumbs and project selection
- **Deploy controls** — Publish your work

## Getting started

### To build something new:
1. Go to the **Builder workspace**
2. Create components on the Canvas or ask Triton for help
3. Configure and test using the Properties Panel

### To use your agents:
1. Go to the **Chat workspace**
2. Enable relevant projects in the right panel
3. Start conversing with your agent

> tip: Build in Builder, use in Chat. Most development happens in Builder; most conversations happen in Chat.
