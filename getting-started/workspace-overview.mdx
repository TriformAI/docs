**Top Bar** — Navigation, breadcrumbs, and deploy  
**Canvas** — Visual workspace where you build  
**Chat Panel** — Triton, your AI assistant  
**Properties Panel** — Configuration, inputs, and execution

## Basic interactions

**Click** — Select a node  
**Double-click** — Open a node (Project/Flow/Agent)  
**Right-click** — Context menus

## Quick start

1. Create a Project or Flow on the Canvas
2. Or ask Triton to build something for you
3. Execute with a test payload from Properties → Execute

> tip: Try building a Flow with Input → Action (returns a message) → Output. Execute it with a simple JSON payload to verify your setup.
