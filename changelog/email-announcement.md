# Subject: 🚀 Major Triform Update: Storage, Scheduled Workflows & More!

---

Hi there! 👋

We've just shipped our biggest update yet, and we're excited to share what's new!

## 🎯 Four Game-Changing Features

### 1. 📦 Complete Storage System
Store and retrieve files directly in your workflows. Upload documents, process images, generate reports — it all just works with our new `save_file()` and `get_file()` functions.

Schedule your workflows to run automatically. Set up daily reports, weekly syncs, or monthly maintenance tasks with standard cron expressions.

### 3. 🎨 Interactive OAuth Widgets
Authenticate with Google, Microsoft, and other services without leaving your chat. Windows auto-close, status updates in real-time — it's magical.

### 4. 📊 Executions Dashboard
A dedicated page to monitor all your workflow executions. See history, track status, and debug with ease.
