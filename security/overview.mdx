## Our commitment to security

Security is fundamental to Triform. We implement industry-standard practices to protect your Projects, data, and credentials.

## Data encryption

### At rest

All data stored in Triform is encrypted using **AES-256** encryption.

**Encrypted data includes:**
- Project code and configurations
- Execution logs and traces
- Global Variables (especially secrets)
- API keys
- User information

**Key management:** Encryption keys are managed using industry-standard key management services, rotated regularly, and never stored alongside encrypted data.

### In transit

All communication with Triform uses **TLS 1.2+** encryption.

**Encrypted connections:**
- Web interface (HTTPS)
- API requests (HTTPS)
- Webhook callbacks (HTTPS)
- Database connections (encrypted)
- Internal service communication (mutual TLS)

**Certificate management:** We use trusted Certificate Authorities and monitor certificate expiration.

## Authentication

### Supported methods

**OAuth 2.0 providers:**
- Discord
- GitHub  
- Google (Enterprise)

**Magic Link:** Passwordless email authentication

**Benefits:**
- No password management burden
- Leverage provider security (2FA, etc.)
- Single sign-on capabilities

### Session management

**Security features:**
- Sessions expire after inactivity
- IP address validation (optional)
- Device fingerprinting
- Concurrent session limits

**User controls:**
- View active sessions
- Revoke individual sessions
- Revoke all sessions (sign out everywhere)

### Two-factor authentication (2FA)

**Strongly recommended for:**
- Organization Admins
- Users with deployment permissions
- Users handling sensitive Projects

**Supported methods:**
- Authenticator apps (TOTP)
- SMS (where available)
- Backup codes

**Enforcement:** Organization Admins can require 2FA for all members.

## Authorization

### Role-based access control (RBAC)

**Organization roles:**
- **Admin** — Full access
- **Editor** — Create, edit, execute
- **Viewer** — Read-only

**Project-level permissions:**
- Fine-grained per-Project overrides
- Specific user grants
- Temporary access grants

### API key security

**Best practices enforced:**
- Keys are hashed in storage (irreversible)
- Keys shown only once upon creation
- Keys can be scoped to specific Projects
- Keys can be restricted by permissions
- Keys can expire automatically
- Key usage is logged

**User responsibilities:**
- Store keys securely (environment variables, secret managers)
- Rotate keys regularly (90-day recommendation)
- Revoke unused keys
- Never commit to version control

## Network security

### API security

**Protection mechanisms:**
- Rate limiting (prevents abuse)
- DDoS mitigation
- IP allowlisting (Enterprise)
- Request signature verification (HMAC)
- Input validation and sanitization

**Monitoring:**
- Anomaly detection
- Suspicious activity alerts
- Failed authentication tracking

### Webhook security

**Verification options:**
- API key authentication
- HMAC signature validation
- IP allowlisting
- Request origin validation

**Replay attack prevention:**
- Timestamp validation
- Nonce tracking
- Request idempotency

## Secrets management

### Global Variables

**Secret Variables:**
- Encrypted at rest with separate keys
- Never visible in logs
- Masked in UI (shown as `***`)
- Access audited
- Retrieved only at runtime

**Best practices:**
- Use secrets for all credentials
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Audit secret access logs
- Limit secret access by role

### Environment isolation

**Development:** Test credentials only  
**Staging:** Near-production, isolated  
**Production:** Production credentials, separate

**Benefit:** Credential compromise in one environment doesn't affect others.

## Code execution security

### Sandboxed execution

Actions run in isolated environments:

**Isolation features:**
- Separate containers per execution
- No persistent file system
- Limited network access
- Resource quotas (CPU, memory, time)
- No access to Triform internals

**What Actions CANNOT do:**
- Access other users' data
- Modify Triform infrastructure
- Persist data between executions (unless using provided storage)
- Execute arbitrary system commands
- Fork processes or spawn daemons

### Dependency security

**Automated scanning:**
- Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Alert on critical CVEs
- Suggest updates for vulnerable packages

**User responsibilities:**
- Keep dependencies updated
- Review security advisories
- Avoid deprecated packages
- Audit third-party packages

### Code review

**Recommended for sensitive Projects:**
- Peer review before deployment
- Automated security scanning
- Manual audit of high-risk components

## Compliance

### Standards

We follow industry-standard security frameworks:

**ISO 27001** — Information security management  
**SOC 2 Type II** — Trust services criteria (in progress)  
**GDPR** — EU data protection (compliant)

### Data residency

**Default:** US-based data centers  
**Enterprise:** Regional options available (EU, Asia-Pacific)

**Data localization:** Customer data stored in specified region only.

### Audit logs

All security-relevant actions are logged:

**Logged events:**
- Authentication events (login, logout, failures)
- Authorization changes (role grants, permissions)
- API key lifecycle (create, revoke, usage)
- Secret access (who accessed what when)
- Deployment events
- Configuration changes

**Log retention:** 90 days (standard), longer for Enterprise

**Access:** Organization Admins can export audit logs

## Vulnerability management

### Responsible disclosure

Found a security issue? We appreciate responsible disclosure.

**Reporting:**
- Email: security@triform.ai
- Include detailed description
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact assessment

**Our commitment:**
- Acknowledge within 24 hours
- Triage and investigate promptly
- Keep you informed of progress
- Credit you in our security updates (unless anonymous)

**Please don't:**
- Publicly disclose before we've patched
- Exploit the vulnerability
- Access other users' data

### Security updates

**Communication:**
- Critical issues: Email all users immediately
- High severity: Status page + email within 24 hours
- Medium/low: Included in regular updates

**Patching:**
- Critical vulnerabilities: Emergency patch within hours
- High severity: Patch within 7 days
- Medium/low: Patch in next regular release

## Incident response

### Detection

**Monitoring systems:**
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Data exfiltration attempts
- Privilege escalation attempts

**Alerts trigger:** Automated response + human investigation

### Response process

1. **Detect & triage** — Identify and assess severity
2. **Contain** — Limit impact, isolate affected systems
3. **Investigate** — Determine root cause and scope
4. **Remediate** — Fix vulnerability, restore service
5. **Communicate** — Inform affected users
6. **Learn** — Post-mortem, improve processes

### User notification

**We notify if:**
- Data breach occurs
- Unauthorized access detected
- Service compromise affects your Projects

**Notification includes:**
- What happened
- What data was affected
- What we've done
- What you should do

## User security responsibilities

### Account security

> **Enable 2FA** — Protects against stolen passwords

> **Use strong passwords** — If using email authentication

> **Monitor sessions** — Review and revoke suspicious sessions

> **Keep email secure** — Your account recovery method

### API key security

> **Never commit keys to git** — Use environment variables

> **Rotate keys regularly** — Every 90 days recommended

> **Scope keys minimally** — Only grant needed permissions

> **Revoke unused keys** — Reduce attack surface

### Code security

> **Validate inputs** — Don't trust external data

> **Sanitize outputs** — Prevent injection attacks

> **Review dependencies** — Check for vulnerabilities

> **Keep secrets in Global Variables** — Never hardcode

### Organization security

> **Audit members regularly** — Remove ex-employees

> **Follow least privilege** — Grant minimum necessary permissions

> **Review access logs** — Monitor for unusual activity

> **Require 2FA** — Especially for Admins
