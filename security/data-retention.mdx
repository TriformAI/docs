## Overview

Triform retains different types of data for varying periods based on product functionality, legal requirements, and user preferences.

## Retention periods

### Project data

**What:** Projects, Actions, Agents, Flows, code, configurations

**Retention:** Indefinite while Project is active

**After deletion:** 30-day soft delete, then permanent

**Purpose:** Core product functionality

**User control:** Delete Projects anytime

### Execution data

**What:** Execution records, inputs, outputs, logs, traces

| Tier | Retention |
|------|-----------|
| Free | 7 days |
| Pro | 30 days |
| Enterprise | 90 days or custom |

**After period:** Execution details deleted, summary statistics retained

**Purpose:** Debugging, monitoring, compliance

**User control:** Export before deletion, star important executions for longer retention

### Global Variables

**What:** Configuration values, secrets, API keys

**Retention:** Indefinite while active

**After deletion:** Immediate permanent deletion (no soft delete)

**Purpose:** Application configuration

**User control:** Delete Variables anytime

**Note:** Secrets deleted from our systems within 24 hours (key rotation cycle)

### API keys

**What:** API key metadata (not the secret itself)

**Retention:** Active until revoked or expired

**After revocation:** 90 days for audit purposes

**Purpose:** Authentication, audit trails

**User control:** Revoke anytime

**Note:** The secret key itself is hashed and cannot be recovered

### Audit logs

**What:** Security events, access logs, changes

**Retention:** 90 days (standard), 1+ year (Enterprise)

**Purpose:** Security, compliance, debugging

**User control:** Export anytime

**Compliance:** May be required longer for regulated industries

### User data

**What:** Account info, profile, email, preferences

**Retention:** While account is active

**After deletion:** 30-day soft delete, then permanent

**Purpose:** Account management, communication

**User control:** Delete account anytime

### Payment data

**What:** Billing history, invoices, payment methods

**Retention:** 7 years

**Purpose:** Legal/tax requirements, dispute resolution

**User control:** Cannot be deleted (legal obligation)

**Note:** We don't store full credit card numbers (tokenized via payment processor)

### Analytics data

**What:** Aggregated usage statistics, performance metrics

**Retention:** 2 years

**Purpose:** Product improvement, capacity planning

**User control:** Anonymized, cannot be deleted

**Note:** No personally identifiable information

## Soft deletion

Some data types use soft deletion for recovery.

### How it works

1. **Mark as deleted** — Data hidden from UI and API
2. **Grace period** — 30 days to recover
3. **Permanent deletion** — After grace period

### What uses soft deletion

✅ **Projects** — 30-day recovery window  
✅ **User accounts** — 30-day recovery window  
❌ **Global Variables** — Immediate deletion (security)  
❌ **API keys** — Immediate revocation  
❌ **Executions** — Immediate deletion after retention period

### Recovery process

**Within grace period:**
1. Contact support@triform.ai
2. Provide Project/account ID
3. Confirm identity
4. We'll restore within 24 hours

**After grace period:** Cannot be recovered

## Data export

Export your data before it's deleted.

### What you can export

**Projects:**
- Project structure (JSON)
- All components (Actions, Agents, Flows)
- Configurations
- Global Variables (config only, not secrets)

**Executions:**
- Input/output payloads
- Logs and traces
- Metrics
- Timestamps

**Account data:**
- Profile information
- Organization memberships
- API key metadata (not secrets)
- Audit logs

### How to export

**Via UI:**
1. Select what to export
2. Click **Export**
3. Choose format (JSON, CSV for executions)
4. Download file

**Via API:**
```bash
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/export
GET /v1/executions/export?start_date=2025-01-01
GET /v1/account/export
```

**Bulk export:**
1. Account Settings → Privacy
2. Click **Request Data Export**
3. Receive email when ready (up to 24 hours)
4. Download ZIP file

### Export formats

**JSON** — Projects, configurations (structured, machine-readable)  
**CSV** — Executions, logs (tabular, spreadsheet-compatible)  
**PDF** — Reports, invoices (human-readable)

## Data minimization

We collect and retain only what's necessary.

### What we collect

**Cross-region:** Only with explicit configuration (multi-region deployments)

**GDPR compliance:** EU data stored in EU if requested
