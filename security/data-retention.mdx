## Soft deletion

Some data types use soft deletion for recovery.

### How it works

1. **Mark as deleted** — Data hidden from UI and API
2. **Grace period** — 30 days to recover
3. **Permanent deletion** — After grace period

### What uses soft deletion

✅ **Projects** — 30-day recovery window  
✅ **User accounts** — 30-day recovery window  
❌ **Project Variables** — Immediate deletion (security)  
❌ **API keys** — Immediate revocation  
❌ **Executions** — Immediate deletion after retention period

### Recovery process

**Within grace period:**
1. Contact support@triform.ai
2. Provide Project/account ID
3. Confirm identity
4. We'll restore within 24 hours

**After grace period:** Cannot be recovered

## Data minimization

We collect and retain only what's necessary.
