## Project Collaboration Updates

We've added robust collaboration features to help teams manage project access and permissions more effectively.

### New Project Management Actions

Several new actions have been introduced to support project collaboration:

#### Invite Users
You can now invite users to a project with specific roles:

```typescript
inviteUserToProject(projectId, email, role)
```

Supported roles:
- `'editor'`: Can modify project components
- `'viewer'`: Read-only access
- `'admin'`: Full project management capabilities

**Example:**
```typescript
await inviteUserToProject(
  "project123", 
  "teammate@example.com", 
  "editor"
)
```

#### Remove Project Members
Easily remove users from a project:

```typescript
removeUserFromProject(projectId, userId)
```

#### Change User Roles
Adjust a team member's project permissions:

```typescript
changeUserRole(projectId, userId, newRole)
```

#### List Project Members
Retrieve the current list of project members:

```typescript
const members = await getProjectMembers(projectId)
```

### Key Features

- Granular role-based access control
- Easy invitation and management workflow
- Flexible permission changes

## Breaking Changes

None. These are additive features that extend the existing project management capabilities.

## Usage Recommendations

1. Always assign the minimum necessary role to team members
2. Regularly review project membership
3. Use admin roles sparingly

## Coming Soon

- Bulk invitation management
- More granular permission controls
