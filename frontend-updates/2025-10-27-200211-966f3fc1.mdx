# Frontend Updates: Project Management Actions Removed

**Date:** 2024-01-XX  
**Commit Range:** d21a17a → 966f3fc

---

## Overview

This update **reverts** a set of advanced project management features that were recently added to the frontend. The following project actions have been removed from `src/lib/actions/project.ts`:

- Project duplication
- Visibility management
- Tag management
- Ownership transfer
- Import/Export functionality

Additionally, the automated documentation publishing workflow has been simplified, removing the AI-powered documentation generation system.

## Breaking Changes

### Removed Project Management Functions

The following functions are **no longer available** in `src/lib/actions/project.ts`:

#### `duplicateProject(id: string, name?: string)`
Previously allowed cloning a project with an optional new name.

#### `setProjectVisibility(id: string, visibility: 'private' | 'team' | 'public')`
Previously managed project visibility settings.

#### `addProjectTag(id: string, tag: string)`
Previously added a single tag to a project.

#### `removeProjectTag(id: string, tag: string)`
Previously removed a tag from a project.

#### `setProjectTags(id: string, tags: string[])`
Previously replaced all project tags at once.

#### `transferProjectOwnership(id: string, newOwnerUserId: string)`
Previously transferred project ownership to another user.

#### `exportProject(id: string, format: 'json' | 'yaml')`
Previously exported project configuration.

#### `importProject(payload: unknown)`
Previously imported a project from external configuration.

## Migration Guide

If your code references any of the removed functions, you will need to remove those calls or implement alternative approaches.

### Before (No Longer Works)

```typescript
import { duplicateProject, setProjectVisibility, addProjectTag } from '$lib/actions/project';

// ❌ These functions no longer exist
await duplicateProject('project-123', 'My Project Copy');
await setProjectVisibility('project-123', 'public');
await addProjectTag('project-123', 'production');
```

### After (Temporary Workaround)

If you need these features, consider:

1. **Duplication**: Manually recreate projects using the Builder workspace
2. **Visibility**: Contact your organization admin for visibility changes
3. **Tags**: Use project descriptions or naming conventions as temporary metadata
4. **Transfer**: Contact support for ownership changes
5. **Import/Export**: Use manual backup of project definitions

---

## Remaining Project Actions

The following project management functions remain available:

```typescript
// ✅ Still available
getProjects()                          // List all projects
getProject(id: string)                 // Get single project
createProject(data: ProjectCreate)     // Create new project
updateProject(id: string, data)        // Update project details
deleteProject(id: string)              // Delete project
addMember(id, userId, role)            // Add team member
removeMember(id, userId)               // Remove team member
changeUserRole(id, userId, role)       // Change member role
getProjectMembers(id)                  // List project members
```

## Documentation Publishing Changes

### Removed AI-Powered Documentation System

The GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/docs-publisher.yml` has been simplified:

**Removed:**
- Anthropic API integration for AI-generated documentation
- OpenCode CLI tool installation and usage
- Token-based documentation target discovery
- LLM preflight checks for documentation relevance
- Automatic in-place MDX file updates

**Simplified to:**
- Direct documentation file generation from `/tmp/docs_output.mdx`
- Manual validation before commit
- Straightforward PR creation against the docs repository

This change does not affect user-facing functionality but may impact internal documentation workflows.

---

## What This Means for Users

### Projects Page
- No duplication button in project cards or detail views
- No visibility toggle in project settings
- No tag management interface
- No transfer ownership option
- No import/export buttons

### Organization Admin
- Project ownership transfers must be handled through support
- No bulk project operations via tags

### API Integration
If you were using these endpoints via direct API calls (outside the Triform UI), those endpoints may also be unavailable. Check the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for current capabilities.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Backup Important Projects**: Use the Builder workspace to document critical project structures before making changes
2. **Coordinate with Team**: If your workflow relied on duplication or tags, establish alternative naming and organizational conventions
3. **Contact Support**: For ownership transfers or other administrative needs, reach out via [Discord](/community/join-discord)
